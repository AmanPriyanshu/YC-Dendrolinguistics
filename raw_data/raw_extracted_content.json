        "tl;dr": "&AI is a platform that streamlines patent due diligence. By using AI to understand the inventive aspects of patents and automate the creation of work products, we enable attorneys to instantly and comprehensively find prior art, produce robust claim language, invalidate weak patents, and more.",
        "‚ùå The Problem": "Imagine a law firm is tasked with determining the strength of a patent or set of patent claims. This is an everyday problem for patent attorneys and could be for anything from a patent application to an IP litigation case. To start, the attorneys need to conduct a prior art search. Typically, either: In either case, they have already contributed a massive amount of resources to this project without much validation that they are going in the right direction. With their prior art in hand, the attorneys must evaluate the claims with respect to the art. This involves drafting work products like claim charts, which require several read-throughs of each document to identify and map the relevant language over the course of 20-40 billed hours. By now, the attorneys should have a good idea of the strength of the claims, whether they need to be revised, and whether they may be invalid. What if they haven‚Äôt found the invalidating art? They repeat the process. Over and over again, for every patent, for every case. Due diligence can continue almost indefinitely, and it‚Äôs only limited by attorney time and client budgets.",

Below is a plot from the resulting publication. However, MACE is computationally expensive, each of the results from the below plot required 1 week of compute on 8 A100 GPUs. We use diffusion models to accelerate MACE simulations, making them computationally affordable.

        "We make microbes enabling ultra cheap metal extraction.": "1849 bio designs microbes enabling cheap metal extraction allowing miners to unlock value from low quality copper and gold ores. Surprisingly, the mining industry is one of the largest scale users of biotech in the world with biomining processes accounting for ~1% of global copper production. Biomining is ultra-low cost, running around ~$1/ton of ore vs ~$7/ton for conventional processes. Unfortunately, while biomining is cheap, it can‚Äôt be applied to over 80% of copper ores, leaving vast resources without profitable extraction methods. An estimated 100M tonnes of copper sit today in waste materials and stockpiles with negative unit economics. While a great deal of effort has been spent on optimizing microbial metal extraction processes, very little effort has been spent on optimizing the microbes themselves. To change that, we‚Äôre creating new biotech tools and platforms applied directly to the types of biology most relevant to miners. This enables us to develop new microbes and tackle some of the most difficult problems in biomining, unlocking billions in value from unprofitable resources while being more environmentally friendly than conventional processes.

We‚Äôre Yongjin and Jai, co-founders of 1849 bio, a team of genetic engineers developing microbes for metal extraction.

Now, we‚Äôre on a mission to make the mining industry more sustainable and ensure a stable metal supply for the green energy transition.",
        "The Challenge:": "The drive to electrify the world is driving an unprecedented demand for metals like copper, nickel, lithium, and other rare earths. Unfortunately, ramping up metal production is incredibly difficult. Copper is expected to face a ~20% supply gap by 2031, threatening to slow the rollout of critical technologies like EVs and wind turbines. New mines are difficult to open, taking an average of 16.5 years in the US after a new ore body has been identified. These bodies of metal themselves have become more difficult to identify. After decades of selective mining, most copper today exists in low grade ores (ore that contains very little copper), making economical extraction with conventional methods impossible. Approximately 100M tonnes of copper is trapped in stockpiles and waste materials without any means to profitably extract the metal.",
        "The Solution:": "Biology! It turns out the mining industry is one of the largest-scale users of biotech in the world. ~1.2% of copper production in 2019-2020 was done using microbes in a process called ‚Äúbioleaching.‚Äù The basic idea here is to: Stack ore into a giant pile ‚Äî think miles long and 100s of feet tall. This pile is called a ‚Äúheap.‚Äù Grow a very unique group of organisms that love acid and use both iron in the rocks and CO2 from the air as food sources. This triggers a series of chemical reactions that ultimately separates the solid copper from the ore into a liquid form. Collect this liquid at the bottom and run a current through it. Then you have pure copper! Miners have been using this process for copper extraction for decades (and in some cases, for other metals like gold, nickel, and cobalt). The process is cleaner and ~7x cheaper than conventional processes. It also produces fewer tailings (mine waste), a growing environmental problem and liability for miners Why isn‚Äôt this used everywhere? We‚Äôre using our deep background in bioengineering to build platforms and tools specifically for the types of biology miners need. By engineering the microbes themselves, we are introducing a new set of capabilities to the mining industry:",

This problem is painful for end users ‚Äì a farmer who has just spent $100k on an autonomous tractor doesn‚Äôt want to stop work to tell the robot üó£Ô∏è ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not a fence‚Äù üó£Ô∏è every 4 hours. This problem is painful for robotics companies ‚Äì they want to be able to sell robots that work, but it can take many years of R&D to get to 99.999% reliability. Robotics companies are used to getting angry calls from customers ‚Äì or worse, selling a robot that collects dust because it‚Äôs too unreliable.",
        "The Solution üëÄ": "Adagy Robotics is a 24/7 remote intervention service for your robots. When your robot fails, it can call out to Adagy over our API. Our trained operators will take over and drive your robot back to a stable state, and then resume autonomous operation. With Adagy, customers won‚Äôt even notice that a robot has failed, but robotics companies will be able to learn from the data collected during those failures. With a safeguard like Adagy in place, robotics companies can deploy and scale robots earlier. Safety and trust are at the core of our business: Initially, we'll be doing all interventions manually. In the future we will layer in our own ML models to help the human drivers be more efficient and accurate, to do predictive failure prevention, and offer a software-only ‚Äòsupervisor‚Äô to our customers.",
        "Meet the Founders üíÖüèª": "We met while working at Boston Dynamics on the Spot robot. At BD, Ros engineered the algorithms to control Spot‚Äôs arm and gripper. Kathleen went on to work at Tesla, developing an end-to-end machine learning approach for Tesla‚Äôs humanoid‚Äôs arms and hands. We‚Äôre excited to join forces again because we love robots and want to see them succeed! We are building Adagy Robotics because reliability is critical to the success of the robotics industry.",

It is a marketplace and easy-to-integrate software for renting out the over $1bn in cheap, high-quality compute that is sitting around unused (see e.g. gpulist.ai). We are two engineers from Cambridge and ETH Z√ºrich with experience in Robotics and Deep Learning. ‚Äî Hi, we‚Äôre Nico and Lukas, the cofounders of Aedilic (doing business as GPUDeploy). We met in high school when we were both 14 and bonded over our interest in coding. Our first project was a cookie-clicker game that we wrote during a sleepover two weeks after meeting for the first time. Nico has since received a Masters in Econometrics from the University of Cambridge with a research focus on the mathematical theory of Machine Learning algorithms (Random Forests, DBSCAN). Lukas holds a Masters from ETH Z√ºrich, where he trained robot dogs at the Robotics Systems Lab, using the latest Machine Learning models. During his Masters, he wrote the official ETH Z√ºrich RSL open-source Reinforcement Learning ‚Äúalgorithms‚Äù library. His Master's thesis was published in the highest-ranked Robotics conference (ICRA) this year. There is a lot of cheap, high-quality, unused compute sitting around gpulist.ai alone lists over $1bn in unrealized contract value. These are the latest Nvidia models in cutting-edge data centers, with Infiniband interconnect and perfect internet. They are cheap because nobody books them. Meanwhile, research labs and AI companies are looking for cheap, high-quality compute but will not go through unknown, unclear websites and the associated sales process. We allow them to book pre-configured GPU instances on-demand at wholesale prices that they would normally need to negotiate. We‚Äôve built software that makes idle GPUs in data centers accessible and super simple to book and use via our website. Data-centers and AI companies with idle compute have the option to list instances on the spot market as soon as they are available, it takes 5 minutes to set up. Unlike other solutions, our software enables fractional use of GPU boxes, so 8 GPUs can be rented out to 8 different people. Other options are either expensive, booked out, or a pain to use We know how inconvenient current solutions are because we‚Äôve dealt with them, both at university and for the previous iteration of this startup (robotics-related). For example, Lukas, during his time at ETH, was given a blank check by his lab to book GPUs for his research. He spent the entire night with his supervisor going through Google Cloud to scrape together a few GPU instances; Google will only tell you that an H100 is unavailable in Region X after you configured and launched your instance. Plus, they were expensive, with an A100 SXM 40GB at $3.60/gpu/hour (compare this to $1.28 on our site). Solution: GPUDeploy GPUDeploy is a software solution and marketplace for renting GPUs. We have made our site simple, to the point, and opinionated - there are no hurdles between you and booking a GPU. We offer very competitive pricing and ensure that the compute instance you book is reliable and meets our benchmarks. We both have a spot offering and an Airbnb-like experience for long-term bookings. We match your spot request with available compute resources that meet our standards. You can then simply connect to the machine to run your workloads. We launched with a Show HN four weeks ago, which immediately got #1 and stayed on the front page for 2 days. Try it out!

These are non-hardware costs associated with a solar project, and they amount to north of 60% of the total solar cost of an installed system! If you reduce this you create more demand for rooftop solar in the market = better outcome for our planet. Contributors to high soft costs: We estimate $5k to $ 7k added soft costs for a typical rooftop project occurring because of the above.",

Problem Just several weeks ago, Citibank got sued by the NY Attorney General's office for insufficient ATO protections. This comes in a wave of increasing regulation and consumer scrutiny on the responsibility companies have to protect their customers. Thanks to generative AI, account takeovers are becoming easier with attacks growing 354% year-over-year in 2023. While there are many anti-fraud vendors out there, fraud is still increasing year on year, which means it‚Äôs still an unsolved problem. How Companies Stop Fraud Today Large tech companies invest in advanced fraud solutions such as passkeys and intelligent device/session management, etc. However, most companies do not have the bandwidth or expertise to do the same. What most companies rely on today for ATOs is SMS 2FA. Yet, we are seeing ATOs grow despite the wide adoption of SMS 2FA because codes can be socially engineered, phished, or subject to SS7 attacks. Solution We‚Äôre building enterprise-level fraud prevention for everyone, which includes: Here is a demo of our voice agent that can proactively call customers if we detect a suspicious action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41VH0FF1mnI About Us We were early DoorDash employees (Anderthan was there for almost 8 years, and Omar for 6.5 years) and we started the fraud & identity organization. Omar more recently led the Fraud Strategy & Operations team and Anderthan on the fraud & identity engineering side. We‚Äôve spent a lot of time firefighting fraud and are excited to help every company tackle ATOs. Our Ask",

We‚Äôre Connor, Vignesh, and Ankit ‚Äì the cofounders of Anthrogen (formerly Arctic Capture). This is actually our second Launch YC post of the batch (first one here under the name Arctic Capture) ‚Äì we decided we needed a relaunch/rebrand. In our first launch we promised carbon capture with genetically engineered bacteria. In this one, we are happy to tell you that we have exceeded what we originally thought was possible at the beginning of the summer; we‚Äôre not just focused on bacterial carbon capture but also on recombinant protein expression and generative protein models ‚Äì all coming together under a single unified platform. Polymers are everywhere, we are not very good at creating them sustainably. Current carbon dioxide removal technologies are expensive and/or inefficient. From plastics to fuels to foods to fabrics to carbon stores ‚Äì every facet of our lives is defined by polymers. Publicly traded companies live and die by the prices of these carbon chains and with the price of crude oil, inefficient catalytic processes, looming threats of legislation/public pressure around carbon emissions, these companies worth trillions of dollars are in a precarious position. We need a way to produce polymers cheaper, sustainably. Solugen became a $2b startup in 5 years by using sugar instead of oil as a base of these reactions ‚Äì is there another source of carbon we can use instead? Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies are also prohibitively expensive ‚Äì current high-quality solutions still cost >$1000 per ton of CO2 capture. With more than two-thirds of the Fortune 500 pledging net-zero goals in the next decade, a cost-efficient solution to decarbonization is worth billions. Our solution? We are creating a platform that allows for both CDR and low-cost polymer manufacturing while sidestepping traditional roadblocks of scaling up bacterial cultures using generative models and CRISPR. We‚Äôve figured out a way to make the most productive cyanobacterial species (cyanobacteria were the organisms behind the Great Oxidation Event ~2bn years ago) grow even faster ‚Äì to the best of our knowledge, going through the literature on the topic, we have created the fastest photosynthesizing organism alive. We have also determined chemoenzymatic processes from the cyanobacteria‚Äôs enzyme output that can create starch from carbon dioxide. We are starting with starch as the quintessential polymer but hope to have a process that is generalizable enough to reapply to other more valuable polymers down the line. Fig 1: Some of our bacteria! These are all engineered strains to various degrees ‚Äì with one of the more promising ones on the left (the deeper the green, the better the growth).

He has worked in both wet labs and computational labs (focusing on catalysis and structural biology) for years.

        "Ares Industries - Building low-cost cruise missiles üöÄ": "Hello, we‚Äôre Alex and Devan, and we‚Äôre building the low-cost cruise missiles the United States needs! What we‚Äôre building Ares is building a new class of anti-ship cruise missiles. We are going to deliver the capabilities that the DoD wants in a form factor that‚Äôs 10x smaller and 10x cheaper. Our missiles will be compatible with existing launch platforms, deliver smaller payloads at high subsonic speeds, and take out ships hundreds of miles away. We‚Äôre focusing on ground and ship-launched variants to start but will expand into air-launched versions, as well as versions with extended ranges and different payloads. Why we‚Äôre doing this A war with China in the Taiwan Strait would look nothing like what we've seen in Ukraine or the Middle East. Wargames within DoD and military experts are in agreement that the most useful weapons in such a conflict would be long range anti-ship weapons or cruise missiles. The United States is not adequately prepared. In a potential conflict, our stockpiles will run out in weeks, and we currently don‚Äôt have the industrial capacity to build at a rate that could win a war, much less deter China. Higher-ups in DoD are waking up to the problem, and generals such as Major General Cameron Holt and officials such as Chairman of the House Select Committee on China Mike Gallagher have echoed this sentiment. Recent conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine have shown that our weapons are too large, too expensive for the wars of today. Existing anti-ship cruise missiles are low-volume, multi-million dollar, 3,000 lb behemoths meant to take out large cruisers and destroyers. But Chinese shipbuilding capability is far superior to ours, and we can‚Äôt make enough anti-ship missiles to counter. In addition, huge missiles aren‚Äôt needed to take out the smaller corvettes and frigates that make up the People‚Äôs Liberation Army Navy. And $3M missiles make even less sense to take out swarms of $200k small, unmanned surface vessels. The DoD needs smaller, less expensive cruise missiles, and lots of them! But no one has delivered on that promise yet. How we know how to do this Both of us have worked at multiple defense and munitions startups. Devan is an Army Psychological Operations and Navy combat veteran and has deep experience in operations and business development at well-funded defense startups. Alex was the first engineering hire at an earlier missile startup, built autonomous systems at Rivian and Stanford, and worked on turbojets at CSULB. Where we‚Äôre at now We spent the summer building multiple prototypes and flight-testing them in the Mojave. In 11 weeks, we went from starting the company to flight testing with our own design. We are on track to deliver early working missile systems to our first customers by mid-2025. We believe our vision for anti-ship cruise missiles can help fill the munitions gap that the US faces. At Ares, we would never wish for a war to occur. But by helping to rebuild our defense industrial base, we can make sure the United States is prepared to stop a conflict and save countless lives. Our Ask We are looking for extremely talented aerospace engineers to help bring our prototypes to fruition. If you know any aerodynamics, propulsion, or GNC engineers who are interested in building something incredibly cool and want to make a positive difference in geopolitics, please send them our way!",

Set up a meeting or email us to learn more. We‚Äôre Varun and Josh, and we‚Äôre the founders of Artos. We met in college at the University of Chicago on pretty different paths: Varun was studying Molecular Engineering and Neuroscience and had taken a job as a Software Engineer at United Healthcare, and Josh was studying Economics and had an early offer from Harvard for graduate school. We started working together after Josh joined an AI lab at UChicago Medicine. One day, Josh reached out to Varun for some help on an AI-based medical device product he was working on, and the two of us have been working together since. Artos was born out of our own experiences with the life sciences‚Äô regulatory submissions process.",
        "üìÅ What are regulatory submissions and why do they matter?": "Life sciences‚Äô regulatory submissions - like INDs and PMAs - and similar filings can be thousands of pages long. They contain an exhaustive amount of detail about everything related to a new drug or medical device because these submissions are how health agencies like the FDA decide whether and how a product can be used. The information for these submissions is spread across a company: experiment reports, meeting notes, conference presentations, and more. A significant amount of the effort that goes into writing these submissions is spent on compiling, reviewing, citing, and writing up that information in the right format for the final submission, which easily adds weeks or months to timelines.",
        "‚úÖ Our solution": "Artos‚Äôs document-drafting platform helps life sciences companies put together their submission documents in half the time. Teams can connect to the sources of data they‚Äôd usually use to write up a given document, select a template or a sample document they want to base the new document on and get a first draft in minutes. Teams can iterate on sections in seconds. They can use a suite of tools to search documents, find source documentation quickly, and implement changes made in one part of a document across the rest of the document or a larger set of documents. And, of course, we do all this while keeping a company‚Äôs data hypersecure.",

TL;DR Astro Mechanica has invented a new kind of jet engine ‚Äì the Electric Adaptive Engine. Unlike any existing engine, it's efficient at every speed. Because it's efficient at every speed, it can be used in new and different ways. It can launch payloads to orbit 3x cheaper than an all rocket system, or enable a passenger aircraft 3x faster than an airliner. Jet Aircraft Stopped Improving in the 1970s Jet aircraft have powered much of the global economy through trade and commerce since the advent of the Jet Age, yet the technology has not changed foundationally in over 40 years. Modern commercial jets are still using (more or less) the same airframes that were originally designed in the 1970s. The first Boeing 737 flew in April 1967 and the first Airbus A300 flew in October 1972. Jet engines ‚Äì which are limited by a trade-off between speed and efficiency ‚Äì have similarly only seen incremental improvements. Newer jet engine designs (like the turbofan) are more fuel-efficient, but slower than older ones (like the turbojet). The New Jet Age Powered flight starts with the engine. To change flight, you must change the engine. Astro Mechanica has invented a new type of jet engine that is efficient at every speed. We call it the Electric Adaptive Engine and it is not only more fuel efficient than modern jet engines, but 3x faster. We‚Äôve achieved this by using electric motors to drive the compressor, allowing it to spin at variable speeds and \"adapt\" to its airspeed and combustion cycle. We built our proof-of-concept engine in just two months ‚Äî something that would take the typical aerospace company a year to build. We‚Äôre now finishing up our first flight engine in just three months using $500k of off-the-shelf hardware. The next step is to build an airframe over the next 6-8 months to use that engine. We‚Äôll then put it all together and demonstrate supersonic flight in 2025. Here‚Äôs some photos from that first flight engine build Astro Mechanica‚Äôs Master Plan Phase 1: De-risk technology for passenger aircraft certification through applications like space launch Phase 2: Establish manufacturing and operational capacity to offer private flights Phase 3: Scale operational capacity and make supersonic flight affordable Why Are We Starting with Launch? Because it is cheaper, easier, and a regulatory hack to supersonic passenger travel. What Are the Benefits of Launching at Speed? An increase in payload capacity at a lower cost. We can deliver 3.5x more payload capacity by air-launching a rocket at 800 m/s ‚Äì that also makes it 3.5x cheaper than launching from the ground.

The Team - David and John B. met in undergrad at the University of Georgia and have been close friends for 12 years. David has a PhD in Computer Science from USC and is an expert in soft-body robotic manipulation. John B. has an MBA from Kellogg and extensive experience in airline ground operations. They founded Azalea Robotics at the intersection of their combined strengths to modernize bag-handling systems at airports. The Problem - Airport baggage handling is broken. It requires an immense amount of back-breaking labor, using decades-old infrastructure at airports, all while passengers increasingly choose to cram everything into a carry-on because they don‚Äôt trust airlines to deliver their luggage on time and in one piece. Airlines and airports have an increasingly hard time hiring these workers and are plagued by frequent system outages and customer confusion and complaints during large weather events. The Solution - Robotic systems work around the clock, never get tired and damage your bag, never misidentify bags, and are significantly cheaper to deploy than manual labor. Our technology allows large robotic arms to handle all bag types and intelligently improve with every bag transferred. Check out a sneak peek of our system in action! https://youtu.be/yFtXG44q05A Our Customers - We sell our systems to airports and airlines around the world. Depending on the size of their airport presence (i.e., is this a hub for a given airline?), airlines will either outsource or hire in-house baggage handling for their customers. Airports are typically public entities run by the local city or metropolitan area and can be more or less hands-on with baggage handling, depending on their passenger volume.

It provides a common software infrastructure to allows fleets of dissimilar satellites to work together: New or external software modules can also easily be integrated, rather than being rewritten for each individual satellite. There are over 65,000 satellites licensed to be launched by 2030. That‚Äôs over $100B of assets whose value comes from the bytes of data they send down. Right now, that data pipeline includes email, whiteboards, and Excel. Dispatch is here to change that, and bring autonomy into orbit, for every mission.",
        "Background": "Flight operations still rely on manual processes and highly custom software. While this is acceptable for single, high-value missions, the need to manage large, flexible satellite fleets challenges that status quo. Fig 2 - ESA Visualization of active and defunct satellites around Earth. This type of modular software infrastructure has been implemented in-house before, usually on specific hardware. (Think individual custom OS‚Äôs before Windows.) Right now, there is no solution for space companies or government agencies other than to take on massive in-house development, or scale up their operations staff. This is the story we‚Äôve heard over and over talking to flight directors and CEOs. The innovation Dispatch brings is its universality - Dispatch allows this functionality to be brought to any space asset out-of-the-box.",
        "Recent Progress": "Fig 3 - Alex and Max at the National University of Singapore. We are beginning an effort to revive one of their satellites with our software. One month ago we wrote our first line of code. Today, after 2 weeks of travel, we have kicked off collaborations with some of the leading space systems institutions around the globe. We have a line of university space programs around the world waiting to talk to us, but had to pause for fundraising in San Francisco. Just a handful of academic space programs function as the source of almost all engineering talent in the space industry. These collaborations are invaluable for our journey towards product-market fit, and provide a platform to gain flight heritage for Basalt.",
        "About Us": "In 2020, Alex hired a 17-year old Max to fix broken satellite radios in the back shed of a Los Angeles dentistry. Over the next few months, the duo would assemble a crack team of engineers in LA and Cambridge to bring MIT‚Äôs CubeSat program back to life. Six months later, the completed satellite was being integrated into the rocket for launch. We have been close friends ever since, and have worked in research, commercial, and government space.",

We do this by running their CI on high performance gaming CPUs. - Engineering productivity is often marred by slow CI that grows quadratically with the size of the engineering organization. - On top of this, companies pay high markups to run CI on the hyperscalers. - Consequently, companies have to run their CI on spot instances to keep costs in check. Since spot instances can get pre-empted at any point, running CI reliably on them requires [significant engineering investment](https://www.rippling.com/blog/how-rippling-used-spot-instances-to-save-and-scale-ci-cd). Blacksmith offers CI compute that is more performant, cheaper, and reliable. With Blacksmith, companies do not have to think about CI as they scale. We are starting with GitHub Actions - today's most popular and fastest-growing CI system. With a one-line change, companies can run their CI up to twice as fast on our high-performance hardware. In addition to this, Blacksmith provides colocated warm caches along with optimizations for common CI workloads (like building and pushing Docker images). Aayush, JP and Aditya have gained deep systems and product knowledge from their time at Cockroach Labs and Faire respectively. Both these companies, with several hundred engineers, were spending in the order of millions of dollars on their CI.

We do this by running their Github Actions on high-performance gaming CPUs on a software stack optimized for CI. What problem are we solving? More engineers writing more tests over time leads to quadratic growth of a company‚Äôs CI run time. On top of this, platforms like GitHub Actions have staggering markups while providing compute backed by decade-old server hardware. These platforms are disincentivized from investing in software optimizations to make CI faster since they bill by the minute. How is Blacksmith 2x faster? Blacksmith runs GitHub Actions on high-performance gaming CPUs. These machines offer significantly better single-core performance, ideal for tasks like code compilation, testing, and single-threaded runtimes like Node.js. The hardware is only part of the puzzle.

The Problem ‚ùå Obtaining health insurance is such a complex task that a $104 billion-dollar industry exists to help employers navigate the buying, negotiating, and administering of health insurance for their employees. Health insurance brokers, the stewards of these transactions, have to manage thousands of complex relationships every year. From negotiating commissions and quotes with insurance carriers to managing contract renewals and compliance for their clients, health insurance brokers find themselves using a fragmented set of programs to store and manage all of this information. Constantly, data and reminders fall through the cracks resulting in thousands of dollars in lost commissions, botched renewals, and an artificially capped book of business. The Solution ‚ú® Blume was created to streamline the relationships that brokers have to manage with their clients and the insurance carriers they work with.

Factories using these methods frequently retool their lines for different products making it difficult and costly to gather enough data to train defect detection models. Manufacturers strive to ensure that only the highest quality products reach their customers. Avoiding the shipment of defective products not only protects their reputation but also safeguards expensive machinery from damage, maximizes yield by leveraging advanced analytics, and prevents the progression of faulty parts through the production line, which can lead to compounded waste and increased costs. A 2017 study estimates that yield losses account for 44% of sheet metal used in the production of passenger vehicles ‚Äî and we want to bring that number down, saving money and the environment. Traditionally, defect detection comes in two flavors: Paying people to check parts is inefficient and a miserable job. Collecting enough labeled data samples to train a model is impractical for rapidly retooled outputs, and the labeling is expensive. This often leaves manufacturers with a critical gap in quality assurance, leading to increased scrap, downtime, and potentially unhappy customers with defective parts.",

        "TL;DR": "CardLift builds co-branded browser extensions to help credit card issuers maximize their share of wallet (and, in turn, per-user revenue).",
        "How It Works": "We build your credit card program a co-branded browser extension. When a user signs up for your card, you can incentivize them to add your extension to their browser. Your users are now 2 - 4x more valuable. Migrate Existing Spend When your credit card program onboards a new user, we make it dead simple for them to switch their card-on-file at all of their top online merchants to your card with one click. Our AI-powered browser extension not only automatically detects where your users spend the most (Netflix, Amazon, T-mobile, Progressive), but also lets them switch out their primary payment method to your card with one click. Users press a button in their browser, and their card-on-file everywhere instantly switches to their shiny new card (your card!). Offer your users an incentive to make this switch, and watch your per-user GMV transaction volume skyrocket even more. Ensure You Continue To Capture Future Spend We don‚Äôt just help when a user signs up to your card program. Our fast checkout technology embeds ‚ÄúOne Tap Checkout ‚Äù on the checkout page at over 50,000 e-commerce sites - making your card the easiest way for users to complete any transaction on their browser. You can even customize the copy to tell the user why to use your card for that specific purchase. For example, if you were Chase, you could prompt your users to use their Sapphire Preferred card on Avis BECAUSE it offers car rental insurance. Make Your Card Program More Rewarding For the final cherry on top, we partner with over 1,000 of the country‚Äôs top merchants to offer additional affiliate-based cash back that you can add to your existing cashback. Your users can now earn double or even triple the cash back on Sephora when they use your ‚ÄúOne Tap Checkout‚Äù button instead of their other cards. Full Demo - https://cardvaultco.com/demo",

We are introducing \"Cloud Widgets\", a set of primitives which enable you to declaratively define every piece of your backend and infrastructure in Dart. As the role of the front-end developer evolves towards full-stack proficiency, we recognize that existing tools have fallen short for those specializing in Flutter. Using the programming language and patterns Flutter developers already know from building their frontend, Celest enables developers to build and connect their apps to their backend with no additional tooling. We enable Flutter developers to concentrate on building features and delivering value to their customers rather than learning additional domains and fragmenting themselves across disparate toolchains.",

        "Company Launches": "",
        "Celest üíô turning every Flutter developer into a full-stack developer": "When I was at AWS building Amplify Flutter, I found myself wanting to write more and more of my code in Dart. I loved being able to maintain my flow state and use a single programming language‚Äîone I‚Äôd grown quite fond of‚Äîfor everything. CLIs, tooling scripts, HTTP servers‚Ä¶ if I needed a piece of code, I would find a way to write it in Dart. The ecosystem for these use cases was immature but that just made it a challenge, which I loved. Use the right tool for the job, you may say. Nah‚Ä¶ I want to use Dart. I thought I was alone in this quest but, I was okay being the crazy one. And then, to my surprise, our customers began asking ‚ÄúWhen can I write my Lambdas in Dart?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhen is AWS going to release an SDK for Dart so I can use it in my backends?‚Äù It dawned on me that there was perhaps something deeper we were all experiencing, something more fundamental about coding being expressed. JavaScript is one of the most popular server-side languages in use today. A reasonable person with no knowledge of JavaScript may conclude from this that it‚Äôs because JavaScript is performant, efficient, or otherwise designed for the server. The reality, though, is that developers will often seek the path of least resistance in an environment replete with friction. It‚Äôs easy to deride a choice in language, but it‚Äôs hard to downplay the numbers. Software engineers are human, after all‚Äîand humans are constantly optimizing their flows. Flutter was born from a desire to solve this age-old quest of optimization‚Äîfirst, as a way to build iOS and Android apps from the same codebase, saving teams the burden of managing two separate products. Then, to desktop and web applications, dramatically reducing the barrier to entry for these platforms too. The vision is largely realized. And, thanks to Dart, it‚Äôs been done without sacrificing performance. Our mission with Celest is to fill in the last piece of this puzzle‚Äîthe cloud. We do that, simply, by starting and ending with Dart. Here‚Äôs how you define a cloud function with Celest. And here‚Äôs how you add authentication. To test it out, you run celest start and iterate on your backend locally as you build your Flutter app. Your functions hot reload as you save your changes, and integration comes free with an auto-generated client library. And when you‚Äôre ready to turn this into a fully managed and auto-scaled backend, you run celest deploy. That‚Äôs it. As a Flutter developer, I‚Äôve never left the Dart programming language, never thought about the many layers of abstraction beneath, and didn‚Äôt even need to leave my IDE to solve an otherwise laborious and flow-breaking task. I‚Äôm back to writing my app in less than 5 minutes. It feels like I‚Äôd never left. Celest is the product I always wanted as a Flutter developer, the tool I had felt crazy for wanting at one point. It feels a little less crazy now, but only time will tell :-) You can try and play with Celest for free today. Our cloud offering has started rolling out to the waitlist and will be publicly available in the coming weeks. For this and all the other goods in store, check us out @ celest.dev And if this story rings true for you (or not), I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts dillon@celest.dev To the crazy ones üòé üéØ Dillon, Chief Celestial",

At AWS, he created the first comprehensive Dart SDK, aimed at helping Flutter developers connect their apps to AWS. This SDK received positive reception within the Flutter community. However, he identified a persistent challenge: Flutter developers were still facing difficulties in crafting their backends, since it required them to spread themselves across different toolchains and programming languages. Recognizing this gap, Dillon left AWS with the idea of creating a dedicated platform for Flutter developers to unlock their ability to build every part of their apps in Dart. He submitted an application to Y Combinator only an hour before the deadline and was accepted into the Winter 2024 batch. Now, he‚Äôs able to realize the vision started at AWS: significantly improving the Flutter development landscape.",

By providing a solution that facilitates backend development in Dart, we are enhancing and completing the story for the Flutter and Dart ecosystem by making Dart a comprehensive language for building full-stack applications. Dart's strong typing and sound design patterns make it an attractive alternative for those currently using JavaScript/TypeScript for web development. Ultimately, we aspire to make Flutter and Celest synonymous with app development in general, revolutionizing the way apps are built regardless of the platform or device types being targeted.",

In today's world, the front-end developer role is rapidly expanding towards full-stack proficiency. But full-stack has failed Flutter developers, and their tooling is at fault. Flutter developers are demanding more integrated and holistic tooling so they can focus on what matters most--solving their users' problems. While platforms like Vercel[2] empower web developers with a fully-managed cloud offering, Flutter lacks a counterpart. Our platform fills this gap, providing a swift and intuitive experience for this under-served and growing market.

We're starting with NFC-enabled employee badges that solve immediate pain points: collecting reviews, accepting payments, attributing customer interactions, and tracking performance. Our customers 5-10x their monthly Google Reviews. - Imagine walking into any local business and experiencing the smoothness of an Apple Store: roaming checkouts, instant transactions, and personalized service - all from a tap on an employee's phone. That's the future we're creating. Our badges are the first step towards a fully integrated, frictionless system for in-person operations. Most tech ignores field workers. We're fixing that. We're digitizing all operations for local services - from home repairs to restaurants. Our vision: tap your phone anywhere to close a sale, leave a review, or verify service, making every interaction as smooth as buying the latest iPhone. - We have over 30 paying customers, including one enterprise pilot. MRR grew from $1,400 to ~$5,000 in two months. We've processed over 3,000 reviews. Founded by Dylan Allen and Ernesto Valencia, CS grads from BYU with experience at Microsoft and Amazon.

That means the right employees get the proper credit and feedback, which is actionable at a more granular level. We‚Äôve already seen this open the door to deeper integration across operations. (also, Apple made an announcement about iOS 18.1 that really excites us, check it out here.) Example: Imagine an employee tapping their badge to allow a customer to leave a 5-star Google Review in just 3 taps: notification, rating, post.

We are Tolu and Philip, the co-founders of Cleva. tl;dr: Cleva makes it easy for freelancers and businesses in emerging markets to get paid for their services and manage their money in USD. We do this by providing USD accounts to receive international payments at very low costs, a debit card to spend, the ability to convert currencies, and the ability to save and earn interest over time. We launched in August 2023 and now process over 4 million dollars monthly for customers while doubling revenue month-over-month. The Problem Despite the growing number of young remote African workers and businesses serving global partners, international payments and investments in USD are still a complex puzzle for many talented Africans and businesses. This intricate challenge can stifle economic growth and opportunities. We firmly believe that Africans should have an effortless way to receive international payments and manage their finances without paying excessive fees or dealing with local currency fluctuations. This problem is not only relevant; it's a catalyst for empowerment. Cleva's Solution We are building an all-in-one platform to enable payments, spending via debit cards, and investments. Our flagship product, launched in August 2023, simplifies payments for remote workers and freelancers in Nigeria. It enables them to establish a Cleva US-based account, effortlessly receive salaries and customer payments, and seamlessly manage their finances, including currency conversion, with remarkable ease. Over the coming months, we will build tools for investments. How We Started Tolu and Philip have known each other for over 10 years and understand how expensive cross-border transactions are from personal experiences. We also understand how hyperinflation and devaluation of African currencies have diminished the spending power of friends and family. We take this problem personally and want to tackle it head-on to enable prosperity for Africans and others across emerging economies. We believe simplifying how people earn and invest in USD will empower businesses and remote workers across emerging economies.

We wanted to automate this process, but we couldn‚Äôt find any good options. APIs were too limited and none of the web automation tools worked. It turned out that other founders were also looking for solutions to this problem.

You can use our tool to grab any list on the web, or you can upload a CSV. Workflows are made up of a series of actions like inputting text, clicking elements, or extracting data from a page. Each step can be LLM-powered, so CloudCruise can translate general instructions like ‚Äúfind contact page‚Äù to a click action and DOM element on any website.

Almost all of our customer calls have had one thing in common: the trader or operations person can recall a time in the past 6 months when a document or process error resulted in the firm losing hundreds of thousands of dollars. These processes also differ between customers. In other words, no 2 customers run their commodity trading operations the exact same way.

It hasn‚Äôt changed much since it was first invented in 1750 BC, aside from the fact that there is more and more paperwork and more and more legalese that no one understands. Your options are to either get generic, 50-100 page policies that don‚Äôt cover anything you really need or spend hours digging up paperwork and financial statements and answering seemingly irrelevant questions. Large companies get customized policies that cover all their actual risks, but smaller companies all end up with generic policies because it‚Äôs too expensive for insurance companies to make custom policies for small/mid-sized businesses and startups. Because of this, a fintech startup will get more or less the same general liability policy as a roofing company. But with AI, the price of intelligence has gone down to nearly 0. This means that we can help customers seamlessly buy and manage policies customized for them - something that was impossible until a year ago. Our mission is to leverage AI to transform every aspect of insurance, from operations to pricing, making it more efficient, personalized, and user-friendly. To do this, we will become the insurance carrier, verticalizing all aspects of the business. Insurance is inherently a words-based industry, and AI has become remarkably proficient in processing and understanding language. This capability allows Corgi to streamline every step of the insurance process.",
        "Buying a Policy": "Traditionally, obtaining a policy involves either answering a few generic questions resulting in irrelevant coverage or wading through a complex, time-consuming questionnaire requiring obscure documents. Corgi simplifies this by enabling users to connect their accounts, upload contracts and relevant documents, and autofill applications using both submitted information and online content",
        "Understanding a Policy": "Insurance policies are notoriously long and difficult to comprehend. With Corgi, users can interact with their policy, ask any questions, and receive clear, concise answers.",
        "Instant Support": "Gone are the days of waiting for support or struggling to reach your insurance agent. Corgi understands your company and policy, providing instant assistance with document retrieval, claims filing, and more.",
        "Our LLM: HAMMURABI": "Pricing Every Risk In-depth risk assessments are expensive because human intelligence is expensive. This led to generic insurance policies that cover a blanket set of risks across all businesses. Because insurance uses words to describe risks, insurance risk was also hard to price with tech. With LLMs, we can leverage 4,000 years of insurance data to create the ultimate insurance pricing engine. The first ever insurance policy was in Hammurabi‚Äôs code in 1750 BC to insure ships against pirate attacks. Corgi‚Äôs insurance model will be named Hammurabi ‚Äî Hammurabi invented insurance, and now, Hammurabi will reinvent how insurance is done.",

We started Corpdaq to solve the problems we faced while running our previous startups, Payfazz and Verihubs. Our startups had limited budgets but many competing products and projects. We needed to be smart in planning around our budgets and projects to generate the biggest financial return, but it wasn‚Äôt easy. On top of that, we also had to convince banks or private investors to provide us with financing for these projects. Along the way, we learned that many SMBs faced the same struggles. Now, we‚Äôre building Corpdaq to help businesses use AI for financial simulation and to secure financing from banks or private investors for their projects. TL;DR: We‚Äôre building an AI-powered financial simulator and financing marketplace for profitable SMBs across the Asia Pacific, starting in Indonesia, where we‚Äôre based. Any SMB can use our platform to simulate and calculate financial assessments for their business. If the business performs poorly, our AI will provide useful business advice. If the business performs well, our AI will match it with relevant banks and private investors in our marketplace for financing. The Problem - SMBs Don‚Äôt Understand Financial Planning and Financing Process Due to limited financial knowledge, many SMBs don‚Äôt know how to assess the financial prospects of their businesses or projects. They also struggle to deal effectively with banks or investors to secure growth financing. On the other hand, many banks and private investors have a lot of idle money in their accounts, generating zero return. The Solution - Corpdaq Financial Simulator and Financing Marketplace Corpdaq allows an SMB to upload its historical business data, financial data, and project data to assess its business health and simulate its business growth prospects. Our AI Assistant ensures that any SMB can score its financial health and calculate the financial simulation, even with limited financial knowledge. For SMBs with poor financial simulation outcomes, we provide improvement advice. For SMBs with strong financial simulation outcomes, we offer access to a financing marketplace featuring leading banks and private investors across the Asia Pacific. Our Ask If you know of any banks, financial institutions, private debt, or private equity investors interested in financing profitable businesses and projects across the Asia Pacific region, we would greatly appreciate a warm introduction or referral.

As giants such as Ticketmaster and SeatGeek have moved towards lucrative primary sales in partnership with large venues, they have disenfranchised a whole class of live event attendees.

TL;DR: Diode is an end-to-end platform for circuit board design. With the help of AI, we can finish a months-long design project in days, and then ship working boards straight to your door. Try out our designer at https://pcb.new/, or shop generated boards at https://pcb.store/. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOoG2gl8wdY",
        "Problem": "Designing printed circuit boards (PCBs) is really hard. Existing tools provide little opportunity for design reuse, so most projects are started from scratch. Since there‚Äôs no good way to test your design, your best bet is to just order them and hope for the best. Thought you were done? Nope ‚Äî ordering PCBs is a pain too. Now you need to source the components, ship them across the globe to your manufacturer, and constantly be on the lookout for part shortages and replacements. It‚Äôs a full-time job.",
        "Solution": "Diode solves this by owning the entire PCB design process end-to-end. It starts with a core of composable, reusable modules that users can stitch together to build their boards. When new use cases come up, our AI generator creates new modules in seconds instead of days. And with rigorously-tested modules instead of de novo designs, we can be confident that each board works first try. We then take the user‚Äôs design and automatically translate it into manufacturing requirements to send to the factory. We stockpile all of the necessary components to remove the burden of supply chain management from users and amortize the cost of parts across all designs. The result is an all-in-one platform for hardware design: describe what you need and get working boards delivered to your door.",
        "Why": "In a past life, we designed hardware at companies like Apple, and we encountered a problem: PCBs never worked on the first try. At best, they required micro-soldering surgery under a microscope and, at worst, a whole new board. These issues were driving us mad, so we started a company to fix it. We want to make hardware design work more like software. Fast iteration cycles, reusable components with clean composition, and one-click ordering to build your products fast and cheap.

These issues are amplified by the increasing importance of counter and inside sales relative to the rest of the sales organization‚Äìthere has been a whopping 13 percentage point shift* towards counter staff and inside sales influencing purchasing decisions, moving away from territory managers/outside sales. To top it all off, there is the ever-present and growing threat of larger players that have the resources to throw money and bodies at the aforementioned problems. * 2023-2024 State of the Channel, HARDI (Heating, Air-conditioning & Refrigeration Distributors International)",

This experience‚Äìfully immersing ourselves in a distribution vertical in order to go far beyond a superficial understanding of that vertical‚Äôs product universe and sales workflows‚Äìhas shaped our product philosophy and overall approach. Some of our learnings: üìç Meet reps where they are: don‚Äôt try to push reps to adapt to a totally new paradigm. Adapt our workflows to how things really work at the counter. üöÄ Effortless onboarding: distributor IT teams don‚Äôt need another tech project to distract them. Build solutions that avoid the need for long implementations. üîí Data sanctity: distributors can spend a lot of time, energy, and money curating their data.

We use AI receptionists and an LLM based quoting tool on top of our own CRM to entirely manage jobs from lead, to quote, to scheduling, to staffing, and finally payment.",
        "Problemüö®": "Residential contractors provide a critical service to our economy: building and maintaining the supply of housing. Unfortunately, those businesses are still operated in an incredibly manual way. Across the U.S., we spend about $675B/year on simple home maintenance. A significant portion of that cost is attributed to the office work involved with finding, coordinating, and managing those small jobs. Business owners need to (and prefer to) remain focused on the real work instead of non-value-driving efforts.",
        "Solution üèóÔ∏è": "Drillbit allows contractors to be entirely hands-off, enabling them to focus 100% of their time on their core business. We have built AI receptionists that can coordinate with businesses and homeowners at every stage in the process. The receptionists then work with our AI estimators to provide quotes. Together, they are able to use our CRM, project management, and payment solutions to store updates and take action throughout the process.",
        "Landscape ‚õ∞Ô∏è": "Platforms that have come before us were able to move service business operations from texting and emailing over to CRMs and project management solutions, but they suffer from massive churn rates. Owners we have spoken with have consistently voiced the feeling that they were ‚Äúbabysitting‚Äù the tool. All of that ‚Äúhomework‚Äù they had to do entirely undermined the value of the solution in their eyes, and so, most users would abandon the platform. Rather than expecting our users to change their behavior - ie. start using technology that they would rather not be interacting with - we have met them where they are by handling the job coordination in a way that feels familiar to them: offering the ability to talk to your ‚Äúemployees‚Äù on the phone like you would a real person, and having those ‚Äúemployees‚Äù be able to engage with homeowners over the phone like real people would too.",
        "Team üë∑üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è": "Alex (Stanford CS / AI) and Liam (WashU CS) first worked together developing robots for industrial construction projects. Alex would go on to spend a few years renovating airstreams and building a house for his family. During that time, Alex became intimately familiar with the pain points in the construction and home service industries and realized how much of a need there was for better, more automated software. At that point, Alex called Liam, and together, they started building Drillbit to support the folks maintaining America's housing.",
        "Ask üôè": "The platform has been built, and now we are looking to drive revenue. If you know of any business owners in the industry (plumbers, electricians, house cleaners, lawn care providers, landscapers, tilers, roofers, etc) please introduce us at alex@drillbit.com üôÇ",

        "How did your company get started? (i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)": "Alex and Liam first worked together developing robots for industrial construction projects. Alex would go on to spend a few years renovating airstreams and building a house for his family. During that time, Alex became intimately familiar with the pain points in the construction and home service industries, and realized how much of a need there was for better, more automated software. At that point, Alex called Liam and together they started building Drillbit to support the folks maintaining America's housing.",
        "What is the core problem you are solving? Why is this a big problem? What made you decide to work on it?": "Across the United States, we spend $700B/year on maintaining homes. Half the cost of any given home service is attributed to compensating the work it took just to coordinate that job. We believe that can and should be solved for. Owners need to (and prefer to) remain focused on ‚Äúthe real work‚Äù instead of non-value driving efforts. Businesses in this industry provide an essential service to our economy - they maintain our supply of housing - but they are operated in an incredibly manual and wasteful way. We solve that with AI receptionists that can coordinate with each of the parties at every stage in the process. The receptionists can then work with our AI estimators to provide quotes, and together they can use our CRM, project management, and payment solutions to store updates and take action throughout the process.",
        "What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?": "There are many elements that contribute to the inflated cost of housing and they impact everyone from the homeless, to renters, to homeowners, and investors. An often-overlooked contributor to this cost is the high opEx in owning and maintaining a home. The most wasteful element of that expenditure is not materials or labor - it is compensating businesses for their administrative work (finding, quoting, managing, and coordinating jobs). My dream is to cut out those inefficiencies by bringing true automation to the home service industry. In doing so, we as a society can take a step towards better, more accessible housing.",

Jobber & ServiceTitan helped by moving businesses from paper to digital, but those platforms still require a huge amount of manual input and babysitting. AI has unlocked the next wave of automation. We already have an instant quoting system that is solving a huge pain point for SMBs: getting work. It does this by expediting the process from lead to quote. Our platform will eventually cut out all of the manual processes involved in operating any service-based business, enabling its personnel to cut out the busywork, \"get back to building\", and double their revenue.",

        "Understand millions of lines of code in minutes.": "Driver AI is the new way to write technical documentation. It helps everyone in an organization write interactive documents to explain millions of lines of code in minutes instead of months. WHO: We partner with chip manufacturing, enterprise IT, and software product development teams. WHY: Traditionally, these teams spend millions and wait months (sometimes years) to understand their complex technology infrastructure well enough to build on top of it. THE DRIVER DIFFERENCE: Instead, Driver AI is a tool that explains complex codebases in minutes vs. months. This enables teams to rapidly accelerate the technical discovery process and save significant resources. HOW IT WORKS: Driver AI works by digesting a codebase, organizing it for analysis, and harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate interactive explanations for executives, product and technology leaders, and developers. \"Driver AI is a paradigm shift for managing our complex software delivery pipeline.\" - Executive Vice President, Global Semiconductor Company",

        "Driver AI: Understand millions of lines of code in minutes": "The gist: Driver AI is a tool that explains millions of lines of code in minutes instead of months. When you need to do technical discovery, you can use Driver AI‚Äôs interactive documentation to understand complex codebases at a fraction of the time and cost. The Problem We Got Sick Of Hi everyone, we‚Äôre Adam and Daniel. We‚Äôve spent our careers navigating complex codebases that had little to no documentation and, when it did, often written by engineers no longer with the company. Technical discovery has not only been maddening for us as engineers but also expensive and time-consuming for the business. It costs teams roughly $500,000 and three months of discovery to unpack one codebase. Multiply that by the number of applications in an organization and you're looking at years of discovery and millions of dollars. Companies can‚Äôt invest that much into fully comprehending their existing technology stack, so they either abandon critical projects or the technical debt just keeps piling up. How We‚Äôre Fixing It Driver AI is a tool that uses LLMs to help teams quickly understand their business-critical systems. We use a simple three-step process: Comprehend: We ingest your existing codebases, organize them within our platform, and generate internal documentation at various levels of abstraction with LLMs. Our platform comprehends code regardless of language, age, or framework. Explain: Next, we provide interactive documentation that explains the capabilities of your codebases and how those capabilities are delivered. This documentation is written at the executive, business, and technical levels so anyone in the organization can understand it. Accelerate Delivery: Now that we‚Äôve slashed the technical discovery process from months to days, you can deliver projects more quickly. Fueled by the context we provide, you can also make better-informed decisions about what to do next, including giving these explanations to LLMs and asking them to do things for you.",

After selling his last company, Adam led various software efforts in innovation at Nike. But he kept encountering the same problem: Nothing new could be built without a long and very expensive tech discovery process. It was maddening. He soon discovered this problem was everywhere‚Äîfrom enterprise IT to embedded software development teams‚Äîand with Jimmy and Daniel built Driver AI to fix it.

We met working at the same lab at BYU when Evita was a Ph.D. student and Rachel was an undergrad. We collaborated on a peer-reviewed paper and conference presentations and we‚Äôve been friends since! Rachel went on to Dartmouth for her Ph.D. and later worked at a startup developing cell therapies. Evita went on for a postdoc and a career in drug development in big pharma. Our Backstory Evita had noticed that a lot of good drugs couldn't make it past lead optimization due to toxicity concerns. The drugs were effective, just not safe. Rachel, working on cell therapies, noticed the same thing, some therapies were efficacious but systemic toxicity was a stumbling block. That's when we started to explore strategies to make therapeutics safer and reduce systemic toxicity, and Eris Biotech was born. The Problem Cancer therapies are terrible! It‚Äôs a race between who kills you first: the therapeutic or the cancer. At Eris Biotech, we want to help with that, starting with mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that grows on the pleura, the thin layer surrounding the lungs, with a 5-year survival rate of <13%. Current mesothelioma treatments not only fall short in effectiveness but are also systemically toxic, and most patients diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within 14 months after diagnosis. Our Solution Eris Biotech develops drugs that only activate under low oxygen (hypoxic) environments. These drugs are referred to as hypoxia-activated prodrugs or HAPs. A low oxygen or hypoxic environment is a hallmark of the majority of solid tumors, including mesothelioma, and healthy tissues are usually not hypoxic. By delivering active drugs only to the tumor site, we can use more potent drugs without systemic toxicity in cancer therapeutics. To develop our first HAP, we used AI drug discovery tools and AI-designed compounds from a library of over 2.6 million compounds. Our first HAP in development blocks the communication between the tumor and its surroundings. This lack of communication isolates tumors from essential resources, and engages the immune system to aggressively fight tumors.

Well, yes, they could, but our approach forces all the escape mutations to be extremely costly. In fact, so costly that the bacteria wouldn‚Äôt survive. How? Our experiments are like running a battle simulation hundreds of times to find enemies‚Äô weak points. This means that we can create detailed maps of the co-evolutionary landscapes of bacteria and our antibiotics so that we can ultimately engineer medicines with a low propensity for resistance emergence. Watch how that works: We then engineer our antibiotics for stability and safety inside the human body using a suite of protein AI models (both diffusion and language model-based). This engineering means our antibiotics 1) only target pathogenic bacteria and not human cells or microbiomes and 2) have the potential to be given as a single dose ‚Äì reducing the amount of monitoring that doctors have to do on patients.

        "Meet the Team": "Hello! We're Elias and Prithvi from Exa. We're developing reconfigurable chips for AI that are up to around 27.6x* more efficient and performant than the modern H100 GPUs. *: Read our litepaper! CEO, Elias Almqvist (right): Self-taught engineer who also studied computer science and computer engineering (dropped out and founded Exa, btw) at Chalmers University of Technology. Previously worked in the embedded software space but also worked on various aerospace projects at university. CTO, Prithvi Raj (left): Holds an MEng from the world-leading Computational Stats & ML Lab at Cambridge. During his time there, he fell in love with scientific machine learning, a field that demands bespoke neural network architectures and extreme hardware efficiency, and also interned at Microsoft as a software engineer.",

        "How did your company get started? (i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)": "Elias, originally from Sweden, was motivated by the challenge of running large language models on FPGAs to combat the high power consumption of modern GPUs. During a week-long event in London, Elias met Prithvi, whose expertise in electrical engineering, generative AI, and scientific research perfectly complemented his own. They quickly recognized that advancing science and technology required a new computing paradigm - one that was both more powerful and sustainable. Driven by a shared passion for advancing humanity and accelerating technological progress, Elias, who had recently dropped out of university, and Prithvi, who had just graduated, founded Exa to revolutionize computing and push the boundaries of (artificial) intelligence.",
        "What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?": "Exa's long-term vision is to eliminate hardware constraints in computing and artificial intelligence by creating hardware that is fully reconfigurable. This would remove the need to replace underlying hardware to support the latest AI models - a crucial consideration given the anticipated chip and silicon shortages in the coming decades. Given its reconfigurability, our hardware would therefore open up new possibilities in scientific machine learning (beyond just sentence generation), where flexible AI design is essential. This capability could lead to the discovery of new equations and scientific breakthroughs, fulfilling one of the original promises of artificial intelligence and machine learning in advancing human knowledge, and solving the worlds most pressing problems. We aim to enable individuals, organizations, and governments to run large-scale AI models on their own hardware, making AI fully decentralized and safe while significantly reducing energy costs. With modern GPUs, this would be impossible. As the AI revolution accelerates, models are becoming larger, and AI usage is surging exponentially. This trend is leading data centers to consume increasingly massive amounts of energy, potentially requiring the installation of dedicated power plants to meet demand in the future. For humanity to advance, we must discover a more sustainable way to run AI models. Exa is dedicated to providing this solution. Without it, we risk excessive energy consumption, which could potentially lead to the end of humanity as we know it. Exa computing is the most optimal way forward.",

However, the organic growth process is highly inefficient and full of noise. Advisors often waste hours building prospect lists by aggregating information across horizontal solutions like Linkedin, ZoomInfo, Pitchbook, qualifying these leads, setting up meetings, and spending time on unqualified prospects. Advisors spend an average of 58 hours on business development for every 1 new client converted, and have <1% conversion rates. Due to the time-intensive nature of organic growth, advisors often turn to inorganic avenues for growing, via M&A, despite those being far less capital efficient. At FINNY, we are certain we can do better with AI. With our tool, advisors can: - Identify prospects within their target niche, aggregating thousands of data points per lead - Prioritize prospects based on their predicted likelihood of converting, a score unique to each advisor and prospect pair - Automate the outreach and meeting scheduling with their high priority prospects In short, FINNY is the one-stop shop for advisors when growing their book of business, starting by solving prospecting.

Mention us: If you like what you see, mention us in Slack groups/social where sales leaders, SDRs, or startup founders hang out. Wait, but why Our journey began with a tale as old as time: we were struggling to sell enterprise contracts for our AI voice product. Even finding companies who perfectly fit our Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) required hours of manual work to research each company to see if the size, product, and team were a good fit for us. THEN we had to get a meeting. We even stopped building so that we could ‚Äúfocus on GTM‚Äù ‚ò†Ô∏è. None of the sales tools we tried solved this for us. This experience led us to develop Flyflow. Our vision is to make high-quality lead sourcing accessible to everyone, without feeling like you need to learn a new set of tools. The Team Carl and Pritee love building products that make really annoying tasks go away. Most recently, Pritee was Head of Product at Lithic (launch credit/debit cards insanely fast), and before that was on the product team at Plaid (link your bank account to any app in seconds, not days). Carl was building Coherent, making Web3 infrastructure so that builders could integrate web3 data (in minutes instead of months). They met at Coinbase in 2018; those were the days.

We‚Äôre Ethan and Isaac, and we‚Äôre building Forge. Our journey started as roommates at Stanford where we worked on ad-branded contraceptives, AI-generated Spotify playlists, and exploring new restaurants. We dropped out and are now on a mission to enhance customer relationships and build loyalty for restaurants. The Problem In high school (post-pandemic), we saw firsthand while working at a Korean corndog shop and a mom-and-pop Chinese restaurant that local restaurants struggled with building a presence. Since then, we‚Äôve learned that local businesses and mom-and-pop restaurants face issues with driving repeat, in-person traffic - while losing 30% to third-party delivery apps. Stores needed an easy, user-friendly platform that could: without having to manage an entire app by themselves. We wanted to create a network that allowed users to easily access multiple restaurants from a single app rather than downloading dozens of individual, white-labeled apps. Our Solution: Forge, the last loyalty app you‚Äôll need. Forge is a centralized platform to access loyalty programs for many restaurants and stores. We want to drive in-person traffic and have rolled out new features that encourage engagement and discovery like order-ahead (at select restaurants), a social points leaderboard, and a marketplace to connect food creators. Our vision: We see a future where restaurants form deep ties with local neighborhoods and beyond ‚Äî Forge will power this communal growth. Using Forge is easy: 1) Download our app, 2) Check in at stores and earn points, 3) Redeem unique rewards at any store.

Once a supplier has been selected, you can continue to work with them by messaging, sharing files, and getting feedback directly on Forge. All these actions are viewable by your teammates, ensuring everyone is on the same page without the need for time-consuming meetings or searching through documentation. Many companies struggle with unclear procurement operations. Forge offers a highly customizable tool for companies to publicly set their procurement flows in an easily readable manner. No more wondering who‚Äôs approval you need or what you‚Äôre waiting on. Even better - no IT team is needed for set up and changes can be made at any time!

        "FurtherAI: AI workforce for the insurance industry": "The insurance industry faces a severe labor shortage while over 3 million current insurance professionals are stuck doing repetitive manual tasks. At FurtherAI, we are building a workforce of AI Teammates to handle these repetitive manual tasks involving unstructured data processing and data entry across disjointed systems. Our first AI Teammate tirelessly handles quote and renewal workflows, allowing the human teams to focus on strategic work. üëá Here is a heartfelt video from a customer highlighting their problems & opportunity",
        "‚ùå PROBLEM": "It‚Äôs widely reported that the insurance industry will lose over 400K people by 2026. On the other hand, over 3M insurance professionals spend most of their time manually generating proposals, checking policies, processing claims, or entering data into underwriting systems. Most of these tasks have remained manual for two reasons: Previously, it was not possible to process the unstructured data with high accuracy, and it was difficult to configure all the validation rules. To make things worse, Robotic Process Automation was too brittle to maintain. These manual workflows take the time of the skilled workforce away from the important tasks, reducing productivity and job satisfaction. One such manual workflow is quote generation: a mid-sized (50-200 EEs) broker/MGA generates 1000s of quotes per month by extracting data from policy documents and then entering into portals. It takes about 30-45 mins per quote.",
        "üí° SOLUTION": "At FurtherAI, we are building a workforce of AI Teammates to automate insurance workflows. These AI Teammates can practically automate any insurance workflow involving processing unstructured documents, data entry into internal systems or web portals, or even making phone calls.

Clarification - Respond to the missing information asked by AI 3. Result - Get the generated quote along with the execution video We are building these AI Teammates to mimic human-to-human interaction. Our initial customers are saving over $400K in annual costs across these workflows while making them 10X faster and less prone to human errors.

In the years that followed, I completed 1500+ hours of training, got certified as an EMT, and started working as a paid firefighter at neighboring departments. When my department bought new equipment or a new truck, we would turn to Facebook groups and word of mouth to sell our used equipment to other departments in need. For perspective, a new fire truck costs $1.5 to $2.5 million, with used trucks ranging in cost from $50,000 to $1 million.

As they grow, code quality takes a back seat to velocity, inevitably leading to code sprawl and tightly coupled services. This creates an environment where even simple features and refactors become incredibly painful. Once startups reach this stage, they often reach for microservices. Unfortunately, this is like trying to fix a dirty kitchen by building a new house for the sink. With microservices, you introduce a whole new world of challenges - orchestration, lifecycle management, versioning dependencies, and more.",

Our first tool, Tach, lets you do just that. We recently rewrote the core in Rust (~19x speedup), added visualization, and shipped test impact analysis support! We‚Äôre currently live in production with a number of companies, have over 300k downloads, and over 900 stars on GitHub. An example of Tach on the FastAPI repo Next, we‚Äôre building more tools to help you scale a modular monolith - architecture enforcement, intelligent cached task execution, smart build and deployment pipelines, and more. Long term, we‚Äôre excited by a new approach that will allow you to deploy your modular monolith as a set of independent services. This will bring over the remaining set of benefits that microservices offer, including independent scalability and fault tolerance. Google recently put out a paper describing this idea. While the FAANGs have bespoke in-house solutions, the rest of the industry is far behind. We see an opportunity to bring this capability to everyone.",

Inspired by the simplicity of Homebrew and npm, our goal is to build enterprise-ready infrastructure software that can run mission-critical workloads across the more than 3 million Kubernetes clusters globally. Glasskube is fully open source. Check out our repository on GitHub. (We'd appreciate a star üåü)",
        "The Backstory & Problem": "Kubernetes packages have been growing rapidly, from around 100 packages in 2016 to over 800 packages on the CNCF landscape today. With more than 7 million developers working with Kubernetes, Helm, an open-source tool created during a hackathon nine years ago, has become the go-to solution. However, Helm struggles to keep up with the increasing demand, leading to complex workflows and non-standardized solutions. Over the past five years, writing and deploying packages on Kubernetes, we found ourselves defaulting to Helm despite its shortcomings due to a lack of alternatives. While working on other cloud-native projects, users consistently highlighted common pain points with Helm. This realization prompted us to tackle the larger issue of package management in Kubernetes, leading to the development of Glasskube.",

It simplifies installation, updates, and configuration, making it easier and faster to manage your packages. Focusing on simplicity and reliability with our CLI and UI Easily install packages in your cluster via the Glasskube UI, where all packages are conveniently located, eliminating the need to search for a Helm repository. Safe Package Updates Preview and perform pending updates to your desired version with a single click (or CLI command). All updates are pre-tested by the Glasskube test suite. Package configurations Configure packages with typesafe input values via the UI or interactive CLI questionnaire. Inject values from other packages, ConfigMaps, and Secrets easily. No more untyped and undocumented values.yaml files. GitOps Integration All Glasskube packages are custom resources, manageable via GitOps. We're also integrating with renovate.

For example, when you want to transfer your stocks from Schwab to Fidelity, GoldenBasis would let Fidelity gather your transfer information, track the status of your transfer, and automatically update their internal records.",
        "Ask": "If you or someone you know is leading a brokerage operations team and wants to improve their account transfer process, please reach out at founders@goldenbasis.com!",
        "A quick primer on account transfers": "How the process works Let‚Äôs say you want to transfer your assets from Schwab to Fidelity. The following needs to happen: This back-and-forth process is part of a standard protocol called ACATS, and it lets brokerages transfer assets to each other electronically [2]. The process above sounds straightforward, but there are hundreds of edge cases detailed in manuals that total over 1000 pages. We‚Äôve read these manuals several times, and they get better each time we read them.",
        "Problem": "Transfers are supposed to take 3-4 days but often take weeks. During the transfer: Why are delays so common? It‚Äôs because there are multiple rounds of manual data entry and any small mistake (e.g. missing comma) will delay the transfer. Furthermore, the operations team has to resolve issues on clunky platforms that were built in the 1980s and run on IBM mainframes. Here‚Äôs a taste of the experience today: You begin the transfer by filling out a daunting form. The brokerage operations team re-enters your form and handles issues in a clunky back-office system.",
        "Solution": "GoldenBasis provides a modern software stack that solves these issues: With GoldenBasis, you don‚Äôt need to fill out any forms. Just upload your account statement from the brokerage you want to leave, and our AI extracts and validates the fields, which vastly reduces errors. GoldenBasis lets you easily track the status of your transfer so you know what‚Äôs going on without having to contact support. GoldenBasis provides modern GUIs for the operations team to handle issues.",

They teamed up to take on their biggest adventure yet: building a startup and reading a couple thousand pages of manuals along the way. Before GoldenBasis, Grant worked at Altruist, where he discovered the outdated technology that was causing so much pain for brokerage back offices. He also led Altruist‚Äôs integration of SSG post-acquisition, which made Altruist the third-largest custodian for financial advisors, behind Charles Schwab and Fidelity. Before that, Grant helped grow Princeton‚Äôs endowment from $26.1 billion to $37.7 billion as a member of the 20-person investment staff. Before GoldenBasis, Andrew did quant research and software engineering at Citadel, where he built trading systems that process billions of dollars per day.

Not long ago when filing cabinets (and file rooms) were the norm recordkeeping required substantial resources. It turns out that computers are cheaper and better than humans at storing files by such a wide margin that there are no longer roles for file clerks in the economy.

LLMs exposed reasoning via an API, so AgentHub was created as an AI-first platform that doesn't aim to simply streamline an employee's workflow, but can completely replace it end-to-end. The flexibility of our automation builder allows for extremely complex workflows to be automated. If Zapier were a calculator, we would be WolframAlpha.",
        "How We Started üå±": "AgentHub started as a UI wrapper for Auto-GPT. We quickly realized that people were using the platform to try and automate incredibly niche/complex tasks but autonomous agents were simply too unreliable and expensive. Our key insight was that when automating these types of workflows, you really want to minimize the use of AI, and keep it to just the core reasoning component of the workflow. AgentHub automations are generally 90% infrastructure and 10% AI resulting in increased consistency and reliability, while being economically efficient at scale.",

At Haplotype Labs, we believe that more precise prevention and screening will lead to longer healthspan and lower healthcare costs. We're building the HaploHub: a software platform that helps genetic testing labs, clinical trials, and prevention-focused medical practices to deploy AI models that use genetics to predict, detect, and prevent disease. I joined 23andMe after Series A and helped take it public after over 15 years as VP / Chief Architect. The technology that my team and I developed at 23andMe has delivered more genetic risk reports to more patients than any other in the world, but the translation to patient outcomes remains unsolved. At Haplotype Labs, we are working to close that gap and accelerate the translation of polygenic risk scores into improved healthspan for patients. We‚Äôre building the tech I wish I‚Äôd had at 23andMe and making it broadly available to the clinic. Precision Preventative Care Preventative care programs currently stratify patients into risk categories for various conditions based on imperfect but still useful risk factors like demographics and family history. Patient stratification allows a care provider to optimize the financial expense and negative side effects of any given prevention program. For example, people with a family history of colon cancer are typically screened more frequently. Driven by falling prices of sequencing and improved model power, preventative care is on the cusp of broadly adopting genetic risk models as a means to further personalize these prevention programs and extend healthspan. These models can also play a role in the discovery of new medicines, and can accelerate clinical trials. Published methods are improving rapidly and new models are published consistently. However, it is difficult to correctly and reliably compare the performance of these models or deploy them at scale. Advanced technology made simple We're building the HaploHub: an easy-to-use SaaS platform for genetic testing labs, concierge medical practices, clinical trials, consumer brands, and payers/providers to: Get in touch!

Hatchet is an open-source, managed task queue focused on scale, reliability, and improved developer experience. https://youtu.be/3myPYVyaqwM The problem Building a reliable application is difficult ‚Äî network connections can fail or be interrupted, the application could run out of memory, or a bad commit on production can take down your entire service. To reduce the pressure on APIs, task queues are typically used to offload different parts of the application logic to other services in the system. However, these queues introduce more points of failure ‚Äî they require new infrastructure, a new set of integrations to monitor and debug your tasks, and are difficult to use in development. As applications begin to scale, application developers are forced to implement solutions to avoid queue overflow and overcrowding and to think about how to optimize their queues. With LLM APIs ‚Äî which are high latency and highly variable in response quality ‚Äî these problems are even worse. It‚Äôs now typical to ingest, sync, vectorize, and index the entirety of multiple data sources on account creation, and as LLM systems get more agentic, developers need to chain together unreliable LLM calls to fulfill requests. These requests are often slow and without the right architecture delivering a responsive and reliable user experience is challenging. The solution Hatchet is an end-to-end platform for task orchestration. It includes a web UI for monitoring tasks, an API for interacting with tasks and workflows, and SDKs for Python, Typescript, and Golang. Hatchet has all the features you‚Äôd expect ‚Äî like retries, timeouts, and cron schedules ‚Äî along with features that developers are usually asked to build, like handling different fairness and concurrency patterns, durable execution, and result streaming. The team We‚Äôre both ex-CTOs and founders of multiple YC-funded companies ‚Äî Alexander was co-founder and CTO at Porter (S20) while Gabe was co-founder and CTO at Clearmix (also S20). Before that, Alexander got his Master‚Äôs in Physics from UPenn while Gabe got his Master‚Äôs in AI from Cornell. Alexander started working on this after years of wrangling task queues and distributed systems at both Porter and Oneleet, where he experienced the issues of building complex task orchestration and workflows. Gabe came at this from another perspective, having spent the last few years working with ML and more recently LLM stacks, where he saw the architectural problems that many of these applications have. We immediately bonded over our excitement about what infrastructure will look like as AI becomes core to nearly every business. How do I get started? Hatchet is fully open source with an invite-only cloud offering. Feel free to request access or check out the self-hosting Hatchet docs.

This saves our customers $10k per family while providing an incredible employee perk: 100% coverage of a family‚Äôs costs. We handle setup, employee education, and claims reimbursement. Hey everyone! I‚Äôm Priyang and I‚Äôm building Healia. We‚Äôve launched 14 customers in 11 states with $206k in ARR and counting. üò± The problem: Dual-income health insurance is a lose-lose for companies and families There are 41 million dual-income families in the country and they all have the same problem: whether they choose their plan or their spouse‚Äôs, they still have thousands in premium contributions and out-of-pocket costs. Companies face a similar challenge: either employees enroll in their insurance and incur exorbitant costs ($17k/year/family) or the employee misses out on the largest employee benefit available, hurting the company‚Äôs recruitment and retention efforts. ‚ú® The solution: Both companies ‚Äúsplit‚Äù coverage Our product lets employers pay for the out-of-pocket costs (and premiums) of any employee who enrolls in their spouse's plan. There is no need for complicated coordination between employers. Employees just opt out of our customer‚Äôs plans and join their spouse‚Äôs. We then reimburse any eligible expenses on the spouse‚Äôs plan. This saves our customers $10k per enrollee and boosts recruitment and retention with an awesome perk. üí° How it works (in three easy steps) üíª Our technology is so powerful that we even sell it separately We created a tool for employees that lets them compare costs between their employer's plan and their spouse's. Employees can upload a PDF of their spouse‚Äôs benefits guide, and our LLM will process the data, allowing families to see all of their options modeled out (see image below). This feature has been so popular that companies like GoFundMe, Stew Leonard‚Äôs, and Sectigo use our technology just to educate employees on what plan to choose. üöÄ 14 customers launched across 11 states with $206k in ARR Initially, we thought only white-collar companies would be interested, but half of our customers have been in traditional industries like manufacturing, food and beverage, and retail.

        "How did your company get started? (i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)": "I started the company after choosing the wrong health insurance plan myself. Even with a decade of experience in health insurance, I misinterpreted my company's benefit guide and ended up with a significantly more expensive plan. I realized that existing tools to address this problem were either too cumbersome (like complex Excel files), overly simplistic, or required extensive time to complete.We created a tool that solved those problems and could be launched for an employer in less than an hour, rather than the days or weeks typically required. As we gained traction, we identified another critical need: most families are dual-income, so helping employees understand their employer‚Äôs plans isn‚Äôt enough. To fix this, we integrated an LLM to analyze your spouse‚Äôs plan, making it really easy for an employee to upload their spouse‚Äôs benefits guide with another employer to see all their options in one place (for the first time ever!).Despite our success, I realized we were only solving part of the problem for dual income families. I kept wondering why there wasn‚Äôt a simpler, more economically efficient solution where both employers could pay for an insurance policy. That‚Äôs how Healia today was born. Our product allows employers to pay for the out of pocket costs for any employee that enrolls in their spouse's health insurance plan. This saves our customers $10k per enrollee while providing an incredible employee perk: 100% coverage of a family's health costs.",
        "What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?": "Our long-term vision is to create our own health insurance plan for dual income families. Imagine an insurance policy that traveled with you to every new place you or your spouse worked. Every employer would offer the Healia plan, so you never had to worry about new plan rules or deductibles, and your costs would always be covered 100% (half by your employer and half by your spouse‚Äôs).This would also make health insurance significantly cheaper for employers as they would only pay for half the costs. Healia could then use its size to negotiate better rates from providers and its technology to lower costs.",

Problem Post-pandemic, dental practices have struggled to maintain profitability and growth due to staff shortages and rising overhead costs. In the face of these issues, they also continue to miss out on thousands of dollars in high-margin revenue due missed appointments and poor scheduling practices, as many rely on manual and inefficient workflows for patient scheduling. What makes it even trickier is that patient behavior is unpredictable, with patients regularly canceling their appointments and going inactive, creating additional strain on the front desk. Solution Hemingway is an AI patient scheduler for dental practices. Through one-click, practices integrate our software with their existing EHR. Our AI agent books unscheduled patients, handles inbound requests for appointments, and automatically reschedules cancellations as they occur. We enable booking through phone, text, and web-based chat. Our software books a patient a day on average for customers, leading to thousands in net new revenue per week. We see scheduling as a powerful wedge into managing a broader set of administrative tasks for practices with patients around insurance, payments, and clinical follow up. Voice Demo Team We met as summer interns in NYC during college and have been friends since. Rohit studied CS at Brown and was a solutions engineer at Lithic, a series C fintech where he was working on deals across enterprise and early-stage startups.

Our mission is to help CRE brokers close more deals faster, earning more while doing less repetitive work. We‚Äôre initially focusing on enabling brokers to generate deal decks in seconds‚Äîa task that typically consumes 20+ hours a week across multiple departments within a brokerage. The long term vision is to take all of these brokerages' unstructured data and build the most powerful CRE database on the planet. Because brokers are involved at the heart of every CRE transaction, we are capturing this transaction data at the source, where no data company in the industry can access. The more brokerages leveraging Henry on transactions, the more unstructured data Henry can ingest. The better the data Henry stores, the better it gets at providing accurate CRE insights and completing brokers' tasks. Eventually, we will topple Costar ($40B market cap) who has a mediocre product relying on call centers to collect data on real estate transactions. Henry will have definitively more accurate, real time data, pulled from both integrations to brokerages internal data (i.e emails and salesforce) and from data emitted by the platform itself (i.e sales comps, unit prices etc.).

        "Henry - AI copilot for commercial real estate brokers": "Hi everyone! We are Sammy and Adam, and we‚Äôre creating an AI copilot that automates the deal deck creation and financial analysis process for CRE (commercial real estate) brokers. For example, Henry can create a full deal package for a broker selling an office building in Dogpatch in minutes instead of weeks. This will ensure that brokers maximize their time in the most value-added part of their business: relationships and sales. Traditional brokers often spend as much as 50% of their time on tasks that do not contribute to their bottom line. From basic financial analysis to marketing presentations to win future business to basic operational support, brokers often struggle with the manual and time-consuming realities of their business. These tasks are an incredibly painful bottleneck for brokers, which interferes with their primary goal of building relationships to buy and sell property. We are creating Henry to solve this problem. Henry is an AI copilot that takes all of the messy, unstructured data that defines CRE transactions and consolidates it into clean marketing deliverables & financial analyses in minutes rather than weeks. Long term, we plan on automating the entire deal flow process for brokers to make their cycle time for a deal an order of magnitude faster. You can find an example of what we do below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZm40bj5mL0 I (Sammy) led Lev for the last five years, a 200+ person series B real estate financing marketplace that I co-founded. During this time, I realized that brokers were often bottlenecked by manual processes & antiquated technology, a problem optimally solved with advances in AI-driven technology.

As carriers struggle to hire, existing talent is getting overloaded and under-trained, causing severe retention issues at most large carriers. This talent squeeze means that per-case performance quality drops, leading claimants to experience confusion and frustration, which inevitably drives litigation rates upwards as they seek representation and support. As a result, average claim costs are rising, squeezing carriers expense ratios at the same time as inflation causes ballooning medical costs.

        "ü§î Problem": "Business banking is difficult. More so if you are global. Cross-border payments pose several challenges due to the complexities involved in transferring funds across different countries and jurisdictions. Global payments are expensive One of the more basic issues with FX transactions is the lack of transparency in terms of the cost to execute FX payments. These costs can include wire transfer fees, correspondent bank fees, currency conversion fees, and intermediary fees, among others. While existing market providers might stress that one factor is low (lower than that of a competitor), that same institution might have high fees in another area, offsetting those savings. In general for every dollar a business moves from the US to India, business loses 7%. Global payments are slow In the majority of instances, international bank transfers are facilitated via the SWIFT network. This network ensures the transmission of your payment to its intended recipient. Nevertheless, the path isn't always direct. Certain payments may be routed through intermediaries, often referred to as correspondent banks, akin to making multiple connecting flights before reaching your final destination. Generally speaking, international bank transfers will arrive within one to five working days. There‚Äôs a compliance risk Each transaction must be promptly reported to the Central Bank of India, accompanied by the correct invoice and purpose codes (of which there are numerous variations), sign-off from chartered accountants, etc. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in payment delays extending for months. And There‚Äôs a FX risk The conversion rates between USD and INR are variable. What you receive today may differ from what you get in five days. If a business converts USD to INR five days from now and the dollar weakens, it will incur losses.",

Our ask: If you are a battery engineer or know one, reach out to info@ionworks.com for a demo Meet the team We (Valentin, Rob, Tom) have PhDs in Maths/Chemical Engineering from Oxford/East Anglia/Leeds & UCL, and a collective 20 years of experience working on physics-based battery simulations. As academics, we were frustrated by the scientific reproducibility crisis, so we created an open-source project to share our research and hold ourselves accountable.

We‚Äôre now building Ionworks to scale up this success and bring the power of digital design to every single battery engineer. The Need Batteries are a crucial technology underpinning the electrification of every application ranging from EVs to grid storage. This makes the battery market worth $150b today (1.5% of global GDP), with projected growth to $680b in 10 years (4% of projected global GDP). However, batteries still need to improve massively to meet a difficult set of demands: higher energy and power density, faster charge times, lower cost, longer lifetimes, and better safety. Why designing better batteries is difficult Batteries come in all shapes and sizes, with complex and nonlinear effects of design inputs on performance outputs. As a result, battery engineering teams build and test thousands of physical prototypes to find the optimal design for their application. This is an expensive and time-consuming process (up to $1000 and 2 years for each individual test), which leads to $100m/5 year battery development cycles. This makes batteries the bottleneck in many product development cycles, such as new laptops and electric cars. The Solution We‚Äôre doing for batteries what CFD (computational fluid dynamics) did for aerodynamics and CAD (computer-aided design) did for structural and electrical engineering: move the design problem into the digital world. Generic engineering software already exists but requires specialist knowledge and decades of experience to build battery-specific models. We‚Äôre building software that makes this process available to any battery engineer. Our solution is built for the cloud, providing the interfaces and cost models to do this at scale. How it works We move battery design into the digital world using the following process: The underlying physics-based models are old-school partial differential equations that describe the chemical reactions, lithium transport, and heat exchange happening inside a battery. These models generalize well from their training data, which allows us to build accurate models from small amounts of data. Our secret sauce is that we‚Äôve built software that makes steps 2 and 3 fast and robust. Ask",

However, although there is evidence that the same scaling laws likely apply to robotics as well, the field is stymied by lack of access to the same large, in-the-wild datasets that work well in other domains, resulting in foundation models with poor cross-embodiment and out-of-distribution generalization. While there has been a surge of investment in trying to grow these datasets, we view the capital-intensive, factory-first approach as unlikely to generate the scale and diversity of data required to make these robotics foundation models match the state-of-the-art seen in other fields.",

We are releasing it for anyone to build themself, along with an operating system that will enable the robot to perform basic task and learn from experience. Our robot, Stompy, is a 4-foot humanoid robot featuring the claw gripper from the recent Universal Manipulation Interface paper, designed so that each part fits on a 256 √ó 256 3D printer bed, with a total bill of materials costing less than $10,000. We‚Äôre using carbon fiber PAHT, but in principle, any reasonably strong plastic could be used instead. Our actuators are quasi-direct drives with between 6:1 and 8:1 reduction ratios, meaning that all the joints on our robot are low-inertia and back-drivable, with nominal torque values from 3-12 Nm. Each robot features a hot-swappable 48V 15Ah battery pack, which can power it for over an hour. We started designing Stompy from scratch shortly after the start of the YC batch. In the last three months, we built five different iterations of the hardware as we‚Äôve ironed out issues with assembly, part reliability, motor torque, and gripper design. Having worked with a number of robots in my professional career, including the Stretch from Hello Robot, the Spot from Boston Dynamics, and the early prototypes of the Optimus from Tesla, I feel confident saying that we have the best general-purpose hardware design for our BOM cost - and we are going to give it away for free.

We digitise invoicing and payment approvals and connect them to the respective quality checks of the works, trade handovers and live progress. All of which are currently managed by unlinked, separate processes and data structures.

        "": "",
        "The Problem ‚ùå": "In construction, Production‚Äî those doing and managing the build on-site‚Äî are disconnected from Commercial, those responsible for the project‚Äôs finances and profitability. This ultimately results in overspending. For example, quantity surveyors spend 25-50% of their time processing subcontractor invoices, mostly because they don‚Äôt have the necessary data on hand. They also spend a lot of time on low-value, manual tasks like data entry. This means that they spend less time on high-value tasks like tendering and procurement, where oversights result in costly mistakes. Lack of visibility means that a lot of stuff gets swept under the carpet, only to resurface at the end of a project (eg. variations). It also means that subcontractors are less accountable as it‚Äôs more difficult to prove things, resulting in reduced productivity, more rework, and longer delays.",
        "The Solution ‚úÖ": "A single app connecting Production and Commercial stakeholders, entities, and workflows, to save time, increase visibility and incentivize productivity.",
        "How It Works üë®üèª‚Äçüíª": "Subcontractors‚Äô site teams log their progress for approval/QA by the general contractor‚Äôs (GC) site team and for handover acceptance by the next trade. This progress auto-fills their applications, saving their commercial team a lot of time. The GC‚Äôs commercial team then just has to amend/review as necessary in a simple, purpose-built interface, with all the production data visible (progress, QA, handover acceptance). It makes valuing and approving the subcontractor‚Äôs work a lot quicker and provides much more control/visibility. This incentivizes subcontractors to build the right first time (productivity) as GCs can more easily identify inadequacies and withhold payments until works/tasks are performed properly, in their entirety. Recorded Handovers are extremely powerful - general contractors are finally able to capture responsible parties and quantify delays, allowing them to enforce liquidated damages or, at the very least, have more leverage in final account negotiation. This encourages prompt and correct behavior from both parties, once again relying on cash to drive productivity.",
        "How We Came Across the Problem üí°": "Stefan previously built and operated a construction labor marketplace. He handled invoicing and payments between the subcontractor and contractor, needing to manually unify all the different document formats (photos of handwritten statements, WhatsApp lists, emails, word docs, spreadsheets, etc) and manage the endless back and forth between multiple stakeholders - who all had different opinions on what work had been done and how much should be paid! Not only was the submission and approval process extremely inefficient, but there was no visibility over the corresponding works or their quality checks, massively increasing risk and friction between the parties. Something had to change!",

        "Why do LLM apps need observability from day 0?": "LLMs are stochastic, and designing robust software around them (e.g., RAG, Agents) is an iterative process. A great observability platform not only facilitates this process, but actually makes it more productive. Hence, many AI developers adopt observability tools early on. Laminar goes beyond single LLM call tracing and provides tools for entire app instrumentation and powerful UI for full trace visualization, trace search, and session grouping.",
        "What is different about analytics for LLM apps?": "LLM apps produce traces, which are essentially very rich text. Traditional event-based analytics tools are not built for extracting metrics from this kind of data. Currently, AI devs spend a good chunk of their time manually inspecting traces to understand usage patterns of their LLM apps. As they scale, manual inspection is not feasible anymore. Laminar tackles this problem by using other LLMs to process rich text outputs in the background. With Laminar, developers can define custom events, such as ‚ÄúUSER SENTIMENT,‚Äù to collect user sentiments and track this metric at scale as they deploy their LLM apps into production. Each event is linked to the trace that produced it, and developers can understand when and why certain semantic events have happened.

We recently released product quantization. This enables index compression so the index can use up to 90% less memory and cost an additional 90% less! We support embedding generation with Open AI, Cohere, and open-source embedding models inside the database for one-off queries. For bulk transactions and managed columns, we support generating up to 2 million embeddings per hour.

        "‚ùå Problem": "Tedious and repetitive workflows: deliverable creation (pitchbooks, newsletters, primers, etc.) is a highly manual and repetitive process involving summarizing information, formatting charts/graphs, pulling logos/images, and other time-consuming tasks. These materials may only be used once but are created often, burning hours of time and resources. Finance workflows haven‚Äôt changed for decades; meanwhile, other white-collar industries (law, accounting, insurance) have had success implementing new technology to drive productivity. Existing workarounds are not a long-term solution: many buy-side and sell-side firms offshore these types of deliverables. This is expensive, slow, and burdensome for staff to manage. Regularly, materials created by offshore teams need to be iterated upon extensively.",

We‚Äôve built enterprise-grade AI products, a capital allocation system that controls billions, and a data engine that processes petabytes‚Äìwe all build and deploy software quickly in contexts where it cannot fail. Our journey began with a simple desire to provide feedback after a hospital visit and not knowing how to. We began reading about patient experience but soon learned that it‚Äôs just one component of a broad, complicated system of healthcare quality management. After speaking with dozens of clinicians and administrators, we began to unravel the complicated web of quality measurement, reporting, and improvement. We learned exactly where and how these measures impact a hospital‚Äôs bottom line, but just how time-consuming the process is now.",
        "The Problem": "‚ÄúValue-based care‚Äù is one of the most important concepts in healthcare today. Value means getting as much quality per dollar as possible, but quality is hard to define and harder to measure. Quality reporting is a massive time and money sink. Health systems employ large teams to manage the process, costing $4-12 million per hospital annually just in direct labor costs, not even counting the documentation burden placed upon clinicians themselves. There is enormous complexity in the process: hundreds of quality measures, dozens of submission forms per payer, and overlapping standards and requirements from registries and regulators. Errors, delays, and suboptimal reporting can cost tens of millions of dollars in fines and missed reimbursements. Once you know where you stand, improving your scores is equally cumbersome, requiring dozens of data analysts searching for patterns manually.",

Hi, we‚Äôre Claire and Ralph, the team behind Maia. Our mission is to empower couples to build stronger, more fulfilling relationships. With Maia, we're making personalized relationship coaching accessible to everyone, at any time. ü§î The Problem Despite the pivotal role relationships play in our happiness and overall well-being, existing support systems fall short. Traditional couples therapy is still inaccessible and stigmatized, couples are increasingly turning online for advice, and couple apps provide static content that lacks personalization. On average, it takes a couple 6 years of being unhappy before seeking help. We're to navigate the complexities of building lasting relationships largely on our own, using trial and error and the hope that love will find a way (divorce rates are >50%). üí° Our Solution Maia reimagines relationship care by blending AI coaching, expert guidance, and informal chat interactions into a seamless, engaging experience for couples. Building a lasting relationship is about more than just maintenance; it‚Äôs also about turning your relationship into a rewarding adventure. With Maia, personal growth and wellness become accessible and enjoyable for every couple. Whether it's planning the perfect date night, resolving a conflict, or learning more about one another, Maia offers a roadmap to a happier, healthier relationship. Here‚Äôs what Dr. Marisa T. Cohen, PhD, LMFT, our relationship expert, says about Maia: Maia is a powerful tool that provides psychoeducation about relationships, normalizes the experiences we have and challenges we face, as well as prompts users to reflect on their lived experiences, values, and goals, thereby encouraging a greater level of self-awareness. The best part is that engaging with Maia feels like chatting with a friend, one that not only has deep understanding of the human connection, but also a lot of sass. I am proud to work with the Maia team in training Maia to approach users from a place of curiosity like a clinician, present tips and valuable resources like a relationship expert, and engage with users from a place of deep appreciation of the human bond. Here‚Äôs what our user K. said about Maia: I am beyond grateful I came across it. I‚Äôve been recommending it to friends along the way as it‚Äôs helped immensely as a support outlet but also grow my thoughts when I fall narrow minded from an emotional state. I‚Äôve personally found it to be far better than messaging-therapist platforms because of the lack of opinions and bias. I think that‚Äôs probably a major difference that pushes me to truly absorb the advice Maia gives. üìñ Our Story For us, Maia‚Äôs mission is deeply personal. Having both grown up in first-generation divorced households and navigated the ups and downs of our own relationships, we recognized the universal need for a proactive approach to relationship health. By combining our expertise in AI and psychology, we built Maia to address this need. üôå Our Ask",

Teams today spend too much of their time juggling prompt engineering, RAG, guardrails, fallbacks, and model selection. Though this is necessary for a production-ready application, it can be a massive distraction from building and expanding the core product, not to mention a sizable investment. Maitai integrates seamlessly between the application and model providers to handle the heavy lifting behind the scenes. The result? Higher quality, reliable model output with passive incremental improvement - without any new code. We leverage our robust real-time evaluation engine to build a deep understanding of the customer's application, as well as the capabilities of all major models, in order to deliver consistent, dependable results. This abstraction layer is essential as the AI landscape evolves and new models emerge. What we offer: - Real-time fault detection with autocorrection to prevent any detrimental responses - Tailored models that improve over time, specific to your application - Enterprise-grade resiliency with smart routing and fallbacks for consistent request fulfillment - Actionable alerts via Slack/PagerDuty to keep your team informed - Full observability through our comprehensive customer dashboard Solve your LLM issues in 2 minutes with Maitai.",

        "The Problem:": "Getting LLMs into production is complex and time-consuming. Teams today spend much of their time-fighting hallucinations, suboptimal output, and mitigating problems plaguing their providers. Though this is necessary for a production-ready application, it can be a massive distraction from building and expanding the core product, not to mention a sizable investment. Hallucinations can quickly deteriorate the user experience and are difficult or impossible to fully fix. Model outages or degraded performance make any meaningful traffic a nightmare. Consistent response times are usually only solved today with dedicated compute environments, which can be too costly for most companies to consider. The more you make progress on these issues, the more you become locked into a provider.",
        "The Solution: A Dependable Middleman": "Maitai integrates seamlessly between the application and model providers to handle the heavy lifting behind the scenes. The result? Higher quality, reliable model output with passive incremental improvement - without any new code. We leverage our robust real-time evaluation engine to build a deep understanding of the customer's application, as well as the capabilities of all major models, in order to deliver consistent, dependable results. This abstraction layer is essential as the AI landscape evolves and new models emerge. Real-time Evaluations For each application, we build an understanding of the expectations that the user has for each request. We then evaluate all model output to ensure it adheres to these expectations, in under 200ms. Detected faults can be surfaced to the user in a callback or webhook. Users can also allow Maitai to leverage these evals to autocorrect any faulty output we find, ensuring clean, reliable responses. Example: One of our customers is a voice-ordering company for restaurants. They use Maitai to ensure the model always requests consent from the customer before sending a text message. Failure to do so would put them out of compliance with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, resulting in heavy fines and lawsuits. Maitai has prevented this from happening 14 times. Highly-available Inference As AI adoption grows, all providers are having trouble keeping up with the demand. As we continuously profile all models we support, we see this manifest as outages and degraded performance many times throughout each day. Maitai uses our model health data to preemptively fall back to a similar model if we notice degraded performance or an outage. Avoid failed responses and get more consistent response times without shelling out hundreds of thousands of dollars on dedicated compute. Our health checks on gpt-4o from us-west2 show consistent performance only ~90% of the time, with frequent spikes to 400%+ usual response times. Passive Incremental Improvement With Maitai, you gain access to models that are higher quality than GPT-4o, 5x faster, and 10x cheaper ‚Äî tailored specifically for your application. Our evaluation data not only allows us to immediately improve output quality and reliability, but also lends way to passively building application-specific models that are higher quality, more performant, and cost less than closed-source alternatives. Access the best models for your application, with updates as often as every few days. Actionable Alerts Get briefed on problems as they occur to quickly remedy a bad situation. Maitai surfaces real-time faults or session summaries right in Slack, then allows you to chat with your data to explore deeper. Never miss a chance to improve a potentially negative customer experience ever again. Micron Thin We've invested heavily in making our presence as light as possible. Maitai adds <30ms to each request (and improving!). Get all the benefits of using Maitai without any drawbacks.",

For instance, in freight forwarders, operations include managing client communications, inventory oversight, and coordinating delivery schedules, most of which are done manually. These manual processes not only decelerate business growth but also heighten the risk of mistakes.

Hi, it's Oliver and Andrew, the co-founders of Manifold. We were early engineers at Convoy (#12 and #50) and where there until the company was acquired by Flexport last Fall. Our broad and recent experience at Convoy has given us deep insights into the complexities of the freight industry. Manifold Freight is our response to simplifying a piece of the $800 billion freight industry. Our first target market is Asset Based Carriers - a radically underserved segment.. The Underserved Large Asset-Based Carriers üöõ Over the last decade, there has been a surge of tech investment into the freight industry (e.g., Convoy, Uber Freight) - but their focus has been maximizing the margin and capacity of smaller carriers (< 10 trucks). Medium to large Asset-Based Carriers, especially those operating with 50+ trucks, have seen minimal interest from tech despite representing more than ~60% of the U.S. truckload capacity - roughly 2,600,000 trucks! (data) Nowhere is this more apparent than in the $100 billion spot freight market. Existing solutions don‚Äôt work well for medium and large Carriers. The spot freight market is fragmented across hundreds of load boards, thousands of brokers, and millions of shippers. For medium and large carriers, this fragmentation creates a logistical nightmare. Finding a single spot freight shipment requires a dispatcher to manually login, filter and compare each load against their fleet and availability. Sorting through thousands of emails, multiple load boards and making many time consuming phone calls. The result? Dispatchers go the path of least resistance - large public load boards. They can‚Äôt take advantage of the much higher value, shipper direct freight because it‚Äôs physically impossible to sort through them all every day. These public load boards take an 18-30% cut of the shipment price that otherwise could have gone to the carrier. For the average medium-sized carrier doing 50 spot loads a week, this represents almost $500,000 in lost yearly revenue (2,600 shipments x $700 √ó 24% = $462,280). The Manifold Solution Manifold solves this problem by aggregating all available spot freight opportunities, including shipper direct spot freight, into one single dashboard. Finding and bidding on quality shipper direct freight is easier with Manifold than finding low quality loads on DAT, the current industry standard. Asks If you have connections in the freight industry; whether they be Carriers, Brokers, or Shippers. Send them our way! We talk freight in our spare time and love it.",

This ensures that decision-makers, regardless of whether they were on the original call, have access to the most relevant information in one centralized location.

After the call, they would need to convey this information to other decision-makers on their team who weren't on the call. However, they often struggled to communicate the value propositions as effectively as the sales rep. This miscommunication frequently led to delays or even halted deals, costing sellers anywhere from $10k to $500k+ per deal. This led the founders to create Mica. Sales reps needed a way to present the highlights of the call so that everyone in the prospect's organization could get the same experience of being on the original call, without having to sit through the entire conversation. By using Mica, sales teams have seen significant increases in conversion rates, faster sales cycles, and improved alignment among stakeholders. Mica ensures that everyone involved in the decision-making process is fully informed and engaged, ultimately leading to more closed deals.",

TLDR: Mica helps SaaS sales teams close more deals by turning sales calls into personalized video highlights for prospects. The Problem: Once a sales call is over, it's up to the champion to convey the key points and value props to other decision-makers within their organization. This can be challenging, as they often don‚Äôt capture or communicate the information as effectively as the sales rep, potentially slowing down or even halting the deal. This costs companies hundreds of thousands of dollars in deals closed annually. Our Solution: Mica turns sales calls into personalized video highlight reels that sales teams can share with champions to keep them excited and help them spread the word internally.

Every developer knows this experience: we insert console.log everywhere and catch some promising leads, but nothing happens before \"time runs out.\" Eventually, the slow/buggy code never gets fixed, problems pile up on a backlog, and our end users are hurt. We started Million to fix this. A VSCode extension that identifies slow code and suggests fixes (like Grammarly, for performance!) The website is here: https://million.dev/blog/lint I realized this was a problem when I tried to write an optimizing compiler for React in high school (src: https://github.com/aidenybai/million). It garnered a lot of interest (14K+ stars) and usage, but it didn't solve all user problems. Traditionally, devtools either hinge on full static analysis OR runtime profiling. We found success in a mixture of the two with dynamic analysis. During compilation, we inject instrumentation where it's necessary. From there, the runtime collects this info and feeds it back into VSCode. This is a great experience! Instead of switching around windows and trying to interpret flamegraphs, you can just see it inline with your code. We are still in the very early days of experimentation! Million Lints focuses on solving unnecessary re-renders right now and will move on to handling slow-downs arising from the React ecosystem: state managers, animations, bundle sizes, waterfalls, etc. Our eventual goal is to create a toolchain that keeps your whole web infrastructure fast, automatically - frontend to backend. In the next few weeks, we're planning to open source (MIT) the Million Lint compiler and the VSCode extension. To earn a living, we will charge a subscription model for customized linting. We believe this aligns our incentives with yours: we only make money when we make your app faster. We'd love to know your thoughts ‚Äì happy to answer :)",

If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?": "The discovery rate of economically viable mineral deposits near the earth's surface is declining each year. As the \"low-hanging fruit\" is claimed and mined, we‚Äôll increasingly need to drill deeper to retrieve critical minerals like gold, copper, and lithium. While mining companies today can afford to drill hundreds of holes to precisely model a deposit at a depth of 200 meters, the cost of drilling will rise sharply as we go deeper. This means fewer holes can be drilled, necessitating more powerful deep learning models to accurately predict the shape and location of these deeper mineral deposits. Mineflow will lead the way in developing a family of foundation models for predicting the earth's subsurface composition and structure. Ultimately, I hope every mining company will use Mineflow's models to guide their exploration with precision.",

Apps are leveraging this new hardware to ship on-device AI/ML across a range of use cases, from creative tooling (e.g. image editing) to video conferencing to copilots for warehouse workers. On-device inference is important for apps/features requiring low latency, privacy/security, offline functionality, and zero server costs.",
        "‚ùå The Problem": "Developing effective on-device AI/ML is finicky and time-consuming. You have to convert Python models to on-device formats. Then, you have to optimize models across end-user devices (with varying capabilities), benchmark them on physical devices, and evaluate performance-quality trade-offs‚Ä¶ in a highly iterative development cycle. Each phase of this dev cycle requires tedious work, like figuring out appropriate model optimizations across different devices. Transitioning between phases is also cumbersome, like preparing benchmarking data for evaluation.",
        "üí° Our Solution": "Neuralize is a single interface for applying model compression, benchmarking on our device farm, evaluating performance-quality trade-offs in our web dashboard, and deploying optimized models for different end-user devices. Our backend identifies promising model optimizations, with automated and guided parameter sweeps, and benchmarks them across target devices. Results are automatically visualized for objective trade-off evaluation, and model outputs can be inspected/compared with subjective evaluation tools. Everything is organized in a single repository, accessible to the entire team, for better tracking and discussion.

        "üîë tl;dr": "NowHouse builds software that helps stock brokerages settle trades instantly. We‚Äôre starting by helping trading ops teams in the brokerage back office intelligently reconcile trades and corporate actions.",
        "üì± Setting the scene": "Many of you acutely recall quarantining at home in January 2021, nearly a year after the pandemic started. If you‚Äôre anything like me, you passed a lot of time switching between the same three or four apps on your phone amid curfews and indoor dining bans. If one of those apps was a brokerage, you might also recall this headline. Two weeks after the WallStreetBets-driven surge in the price of GME started, Robinhood restricted trading, drawing the ire of its users. When a stock is as volatile as GME was, the NSCC increases its collateral requirement to ensure it can continue to bear counterparty risk and clear the trades sent its way. As a result, Robinhood restricted buying to avoid becoming insolvent.",
        "üè¶ So what?": "One of the things Robinhood had to do was reconcile, or match, its trades against its executing brokers and ultimately against those cleared by the NSCC. In fact, every firm has to reconcile trades against the firm immediately upstream in the state machine below‚Äîit‚Äôs a well-conserved pattern. For example, at market open, an introducing broker reconciles the previous day‚Äôs close against its carrying broker, which in turn reconciles against its clearing broker. Similarly, the clearing broker reconciles against trades reported via UTC by the DTC, which holds $87 trillion of securities. (You can think of the DTC as the custodian‚Äôs custodian.) The DTC itself receives settlement instructions from the NSCC via the CNS system, which nets transactions to one security position per firm per day. Member firms are also apprised of securities movements by the NSCC via CNS. A given brokerage may even reconcile its own orders against partial fills or its settled shares against shares that are pending, held, or tradable. The point is that the 20 billion equity and options trades in the US every year are each netted and reconciled several times over at different levels of abstraction in the financial system. At a single firm, reconciliation is done thousands of times per day across hundreds of thousands of trades.",
        "üìà Technically speaking": "‚Ä¶reconciliation is the process of creating as ‚Äúgood‚Äù a mapping as possible between disjoint subsets of two ordered or unordered finite sets. It‚Äôs a generalization of the subset sum problem, which is itself NP-complete. The size of the search space for reconciliation is given by the Bell numbers, a logarithmically convex sequence that counts the partitions of a set. Reconciliation can be constrained by, for example, enforcing that set partitions are non-crossing. Even then, however, the search space is given by the Catalan numbers, another logarithmically convex sequence. This means that the fastest general solution is exhaustive search‚Äîunacceptable for 100 trades, let alone 100,000‚Ä¶",
        "üóÇ ‚Ä¶so how does reconciliation work today?": "It‚Äôs done by people. Even at the most tech-forward brokerages and clearinghouses, reconciliation is manually driven. In some cases, it‚Äôs naively automated‚Äîthink cron jobs executing stored procedures‚Äîwhich is far less robust than human judgement. These procedures are slow and brittle. And whether it's driven by a trading ops team alone or augmented by computers, there's little variance in how reconciliation is done from firm to firm. It‚Äôs the same problem across the 3,400 SEC-registered broker-dealers.",
        "üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª How does NowHouse fix this?": "To make this problem tractable, it needs to have a clear objective function and be constrained with heuristics. NowHouse proposes reconciliations under context-appropriate objective functions to a trading ops team, learns from the ones they choose, and emulates the team thereafter. It also enforces configurable constraints, like adjacency of transactions in a match so that the reconciliations it generates make sense given different business contexts. A trading ops associate need not waste time manually combing through reams of transactions to resolve discrepant ones.",
        "üïì Why now?": "You‚Äôve probably noticed that when you place a trade, the shares (or cash) take two business days to arrive, at which point you can sell the shares (or withdraw the cash). That's known as T+2 settlement, and it‚Äôs about to change. Just over a year ago, the SEC adopted amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, shortening the trade settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1. Maintaining current books and records is paramount to supporting T+1 settlement, and efficiently reconciling trades is paramount to maintaining current books and records.",
        "üìù The vision": "‚Ä¶is to become the de facto system of record to firms and their regulators on the 3 trillion shares that change hands in U.S. markets every year. This will then enable NowHouse to shoulder compliance and recordkeeping responsibilities like CAT reporting for brokerages.",
        "‚õ∑Ô∏è How did I get here?": "I was previously the growth lead for SoFi‚Äôs brokerage, where I saw this problem firsthand. Prior to that, I designed the core ledger API and reconciliation tools at an ecommerce startup acquired by Shopify, and I studied computer science at Stanford. I really like pattern-matching real-world systems, like onboarding flows and fulfillment networks, to abstractions like graphs and recurrences. Post-trade processing lends itself well to this.",

For example, anyone with the title of \"Software Engineer\" should be in the #eng slack channel and eng@ google group. ‚Ä¢ On-call: Schedule smart rotations that take into account balancing the load and using signals from calendar schedules to make sure you don't waste time figuring out who can cover what in a fair way.

The Problem - There are too many SaaS pointwise solutions! Seriously. The world over-rotated to point solutions in SaaS. It‚Äôs not unusual to have 20+ minor SaaS products to do various organizational chores. It‚Äôs easy to see why this happened because you need different tools at different sizes, but it‚Äôs also not what users want. It‚Äôs expensive, annoying to manage, and none of them work together to create a better user experience. The Solution - OrgOrg! OrgOrg draws on 25 years of experience leading high-performing teams from founding to big tech. We're building a suite with all the internal SaaS tools that you need for each stage of your company. You save money, time, and they all work together nicely. For early stage companies, Go links, ‚ÄúBig Rock‚Äù Goal tracking, and branded New browser tabs (with countdowns to your next milestone ‚Äî like Demo Day) are great ways to stay focused and efficient. For larger teams, add in Profiles with personality, Smart Groups (eg, add all engineers to the #eng channel & eng@ group), All Hands Q&A, and smart On-Call management to fight the problems that come with the complexity of larger teams. Our roadmap is full of high utility internal apps and tools that build on each to help you run your company better. No matter the size of your org, you can be confident that the right internal tools will be in place when you need them. Just as no one buys Google Slides alone, buying just an All-Hands Q&A product isn‚Äôt enough. OrgOrg‚Äôs suite offers significantly more value than the sum of the parts of existing pointwise solutions.

        "How did your company get started? (i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)": "OrgOrg is the culmination of 25 years of being an operator. OrgOrg is the third company I‚Äôve founded. My first, Zenter (YC S07), was acquired by Google and turned into Google Slide. I led much of the G Suite in the early days and grew the product to Google‚Äôs 4th billion dollar, and billion user product. As good as Google Workspace is as an employee productivity suite, it misses the mark as an organizational productivity suite. The tooling and applications needed to run organizations is largely missing from the suite. So, when I founded my second company in 2016, Humu, I found myself having to rebuild all the internal tools I‚Äôd come to rely on to run a productive organization. Things like great employee profiles, anonymous all hands Q&A software, go links, rules based groups of people, and about a dozen more tools and apps that are required run the organization were all absent from existing productivity suites. While there are point-wise solutions to solve some of these problems, it‚Äôs clear organizations need a suite of them that seamlessly operate together. In much the same way as the market for the employee productivity suite of docs, sheets and slides is larger than sum of the parts, so to is the market for an organizational productivity suite that brings the best tools together in a cohesive way.",
        "What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?": "OrgOrg is solving the problems that arise from organizational complexity, so we can all be more productive and have a bigger impact. I‚Äôve always had a passion for making work better for people. I believe working is fundamental to the human experience. We have a natural propensity to come together and build things that are bigger than what we could do by ourselves. In it‚Äôs purest form, work gives us a sense of purpose and joy. However, as organizations add people and grow linearly, the complexity that comes from each addition team member grows exponentially. The added complexity of having to interact with more people causes inefficiencies in communication, reduced focus and velocity, and erodes the sense of purpose that is critical to building successful teams. These problems can be mitigated with the right tooling and technology. With the advent of AI, it‚Äôs clear we are on the brink of a change in the labor market as big as the industrial revolution. But, make no mistake, work isn‚Äôt going away ‚Äî because humans will always find ways to work together. The companies that embrace the fundamental reasons why we work, and embrace the technology to help mitigate the challenges of working together, are going to be the ones that are successful. In 2007, with the advent of GSuite (Google Workspace), we fundamentally changed the way people work, and OrgOrg is going to do it again.",

        "Overstand - The platform for upselling your enterprise accounts": "TLDR: Overstand helps enterprise software teams maximize revenue by reading all customer communication channels (chat, email, call recordings, support tickets) to uncover opportunities for contract expansion. The problem: Big tech companies know that one of the best ways to increase revenue is to bring more value to existing customers. But customer account management involves not just sales, but also support, customer success, implementation teams, and so on. Customers might voice problems that are not conveyed in a timely manner (or at all!) to those responsible for expanding the account. Enterprise software companies are leaving a lot of potential revenue on the table‚Äî some offer a whole menu of products, with each enterprise customer only taking advantage of one or a few of the offerings. The solution: Overstand is designed to read all customer communications and flag opportunities for expansion of customer accounts. It identifies hidden expansion opportunities that are buried in customer communications by analyzing every single message and comparing it to product docs and even existing use cases at other enterprise accounts. The team: We met at Palantir several years ago and both recognized the importance of empowering customer-facing teams to fully understand and sell highly technical and complex products. Mihir was a PM and engineering lead at Palantir and often felt that many existing customers could have further benefited from using his products. Senta managed customer accounts valued in the double-digit millions and often observed challenges associated with upselling into existing accounts.

        "ParcelBio: Programmable delivery of mRNA medicines": "Summary: ParcelBio is addressing the biggest problem in RNA therapeutics: delivery. We are developing a programmable technology to safely and specifically deliver mRNA to diverse cell types in the body. We will initially use this technology to develop drugs for long-overlooked kidney disorders, chronic liver diseases, and immune system dysregulation‚Äîbut that‚Äôs just the beginning. The Problem: mRNA therapeutics have already saved millions of lives with the advent of the COVID-19 vaccine. We believe they can save millions more. That‚Äôs because mRNA is a versatile therapeutic: It can be programmed to produce just about anything the body could need. The key hurdle limiting the full therapeutic potential of mRNA is delivery; it‚Äôs hard to get enough mRNA exactly where it needs to go. To safely and efficiently deliver an mRNA therapeutic requires a delivery vehicle that imparts two features: stability and targeting. The current delivery vehicle of choice is a lipid nanoparticle (LNP), which is essentially a fat droplet that encapsulates the mRNA. LNPs work great for vaccines, but applications beyond vaccines require more specific targeting and higher doses than what best-in-class LNP technologies can provide. Our Solution: Our proprietary technology, which we call ‚ÄòSTAmP‚Äô (Stabilization and Targeting by Annealing mRNA to ParcelOligos), is a completely new way of delivering an mRNA medicine without a nanoparticle. STAmP‚Äôs key innovation is the use of ‚ÄòParcelOligos‚Äô, which was inspired by the clinical success of another type of RNA therapeutic called siRNA that has already moved on from nanoparticle-based delivery. ParcelOligos bind to an mRNA molecule to convert it into a more stable form so that it can survive the journey to desired cell types. In addition to imparting stability, ParcelOligos are attached to interchangeable ‚Äòkeys‚Äô that only unlock cells with the corresponding lock. These keys are based on naturally occurring molecules that the body already uses to recognize specific cell types. We will use STAmP to develop wholly-owned drugs for kidney, liver, and immune system disorders. We will also partner with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to make improved mRNA vaccines and to deliver CRISPR gene-editing tools to diverse cell types. The Team: David holds a PhD from MIT where he studied the function of siRNAs, was a faculty member at UCSF investigating mRNA biology, and most recently was the Vice President of RNA Platform at a leading mRNA therapeutics startup, Orbital Therapeutics. Chris received his PhD from UCSF where he studied RNA protection in viruses. He was hired by David at Orbital Therapeutics, where he went on to author multiple pending patents related to the stabilization of therapeutic RNAs.

Anyone pursuing a work or immigrant visa will tell you about the difficulties of lottery systems, exorbitant fees, and endless paperwork. At Parley, we believe an important piece to fixing this process is automating work for immigration firms. For some visa types, a lawyer or legal writer spends several days writing a single application, learning about the most complex and technical professions, collating hundreds of pages of evidence, and synthesizing it all into a cohesive petition. Meanwhile, an applicant eagerly waits for their opportunity. By helping lawyers work better on a daily basis, we hope to accelerate Parley‚Äôs speed to impact ‚Äî reducing the complexity of immigration. ‚úçÔ∏è The Solution Parley makes immigration processes easier. Our first product, the O-1A Writer, helps immigration attorneys speed write a petition while keeping them in the loop. As a lawyer does the critical thinking in specifying what argument they want to make, our writer dynamically pulls content from an applicant's evidence, fits that material to the context of the application, and automatically drafts a petition for review. We do this all directly in Microsoft Word ‚Äî where most attorneys spend their time writing. We‚Äôre quickly expanding support for more visa types like the H-1B, TN, EB-1, EB-2 NIW, L-1, and more.

Decades of decline and entire generations shying away from manufacturing jobs have left the industry facing an expected 2.4 million jobs going unfulfilled by 2030. The obvious solution is to use robots, but 75% of all U.S. manufacturers are effectively unable to use traditional robotic automation due to their high-mix production: they produce a wide array of products in small quantities. Traditional automation is rigid and needs new fixturing and re-programming for each part, and doesn‚Äôt provide ROI for high-mix manufacturers since so little of each part is produced. If America is unable to capitalize on the current manufacturing and AI boom, we lose out on $1 trillion per year in opportunity cost and the chance to strengthen our weakened industrial base. High-mix manufacturers are a crucial component for this and they urgently need adaptable automation solutions that can cheaply handle their large variety of parts.",

We do this by leveraging the latest advances in foundational vision models, allowing us to avoid the large data requirements that prior attempts of adding vision to industrial robots faced.

We use AI to automatically determine what a lawyer is doing on their computer or mobile phone and generate timesheets for them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldqhzN93dMY The Problem ‚è≥ Over 80% of law firms bill their clients by the hour. Lawyers manually track all their work in 6-minute increments and write descriptions of the tasks performed. Those time entries are then used to generate client bills, which partners spend hours reviewing before they‚Äôre sent out. This process is time consuming and error-prone, resulting in: The Solution ‚ú® PointOne completely automates the process of time tracking. Our application captures the work done on a lawyer‚Äôs laptop and mobile phone, uses AI to interpret the tasks, and generates time entries that are used to bill the client. These time entries are customized firm-by-firm and client-by-client to fit their specific billing preferences. This allows firms to: Coming soon, we‚Äôll be releasing a billing copilot for partners that will cut down on bill review time by taking a first pass at redlining client bills. Why we built PointOne üíº Adrian was a corporate lawyer at Fenwick & West, doing financings and acquisitions for companies like Robinhood, Stripe, Upwork, and SentinelOne. He was chronically delinquent in submitting his timesheets and nearly lost his bonus on multiple occasions as a result.

We return in real time faster than LLMs and keep our threat intelligence up to date so you don‚Äôt have to. Hey folks! We are excited to launch the first AI Detection and Response (AIDR) system for LLM Applications. For those familiar with traditional security, think of us as EDR for LLM systems. Users of LLM applications want powerful functionality, and need a way to preserve that powerful functionality without exposing themselves to security risks, specifically: Common misconceptions There are some common misconceptions about securing LLM applications. LLM security risks still exist even if: If LLM applications read external data and send it to an LLM, they inherently have security risks and create security risks for their customers. We know this because we‚Äôve pentested over 50 LLM applications in production and found the same vulnerability: reading data that could have originated from an attacker can manipulate LLMs into: LLMs are now the weakest link in the chain, and traditional security risks are being delivered via LLMs straight into your systems and nobody is monitoring it. It is the same risk as arbitrarily executing code or hiring a malicious employee. What is the threat? LLM applications and agents commonly do three things: Attackers can easily hide, within larger input sources, adversarial input intended to mislead LLMs. Here‚Äôs an example of an adversarial input hidden in white text, intended to exfiltrate user data files, on a seemingly innocent website: When somebody sends this webpage to an LLM for processing, the injected content overrides your system prompt. If the system prompt is overridden, the LLM is now your adversary and any other data accessible by the LLM can be leaked easily, the LLM can execute phishing attacks within your trusted environment, or it can manipulate systems it has access to. So although a normal workflow and what you expect might look like this: Simply by having an LLM in the loop, you expose yourself to much worse risks: Attacks in the Wild We‚Äôve gone through most of the published adversarial inputs over the past year, and here are the top three threats we saw, ranked by severity. Let‚Äôs walk through a few of the most interesting examples. 1) Hacking Google Bard - From Prompt Injection to Data Exfiltration This is an exciting one. The pentesters found that if a user of Bard Chat navigates to any source with an injected instruction - even a YouTube video - the attacker would be able to get the contents of any uploaded file from Google Drive. They did this by getting the chat to render a markdown image, and append the contents of the Google Drive documents to the image. When the image is rendered in markdown, a GET request is sent to the attacker‚Äôs server, and they get all the content. That‚Äôs scary; imagine a random attacker having access to all of your Google docs just because you chatted with Bard Chat. (source: https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/google-bard-data-exfiltration/) PromptArmor would prevent this immediately - it catches the inputted injection they used. It would also flag some of the exfiltrated information (PII such as name, address, etc) on the output side. 2) Turning Bing Chat Into a Data Pirate (source: https://greshake.github.io/) This one is scary. The attacker successfully injected Bing Chat to turn into an adversarial social engineer, which is actively trying to exfiltrate data. It would sneakily get the user to reveal their name, and then as soon as the user revealed their name, it would suggest that the user clicks on an exfiltration link. The link URL has the contents of their name appended but obfuscated. (source: https://greshake.github.io/) The scary thing is that the user thinks they are safe because they are interacting with Bing Chat, a trusted source, but they are really perpetually at risk. This could be used to scam a user into giving up their credit card information, their date of birth, their address, or other personal information. A scammer could use this information to propagate more threats (more phishing, scam mail, blackmail, etc). Again, PromptArmor catches this injection on input, so it would never be sent to the LLM. It would also flag the output link as malicious and catch the PII before the link is rendered to the user. You can also check out our blog post which has another example of data exfiltration. Why do I need to worry about this now? How does PromptArmor work? There are two ways to make sure LLM agents and applications are secure enough to protect user data and prevent known threats like phishing, malware, etc. Given that the agents most useful to customers are also the most powerful, we find the second approach to be more fruitful. However, usually, after a threat is detected and reported, companies seem to go into panic mode and implement approach 1 in a hurry, which makes their product worse. We have 3 offerings that fall under the second approach: PromptArmor continually monitors for threats across all mechanisms your LLM Agent or Application uses to interact with data sources (external or internal), and LLMs. Threats are always evolving and new ones are emerging every day. PromptArmor stays up to date so you don‚Äôt have to. Here is a system diagram, which mirrors the architecture many companies are using. How do I sign up?",

This is because building production-ready apps is not only writing code. It‚Äôs writing code, running it, debugging, iterating, changing requirements, refactoring, and many other mechanisms that developers do every day. While LLMs are getting smarter every single day, they will always be answering machines‚Äîthey won‚Äôt have the mechanics that allow humans to iteratively progress on building an app. The good thing is that all these mechanisms are deterministic and repetitive.",

Translating your whole product takes time and perhaps maybe weeks or months of engineering effort, depending on what solution you go with. How do you deliver consistent and accurate translations with context about how your application works? Software translation mostly relies on engineers haphazardly providing text to an internationalization service, which then needs to translate on a string by string basis. This strategy loses important context and leads to poor quality, inconsistent translations, all while putting unnecessary work on engineers. If your company already has a robust localization system, there's a whole host of other problems. You need to juggle the constant barrage of customer confusion, growth and change to your product and messaging, and external demands to adjust wording and phrasing, sometimes at the last second. Keeping up with all of that and making your language and messaging consistent with how your product works and what your intents are is super tough and puts unnecessary stress on your localization team.

It‚Äôs Saif, Omar, and Pradhit here to introduce you to Reform! ü§ì TL;DR Reform is the easiest way for dev teams to build modern logistics software fast. Logistics service providers use our pre-built components and APIs to build software that can automate tasks such as quoting, shipment creation, and customs clearance filing. One of the largest freight forwarders in Latin America is using Reform to automate shipment creation and invoice processing. ‚ùå Problem Logistics service providers rely on dated, archaic ERP and transportation management systems (TMS) to manage their operations. These systems are rigid, closed, and opinionated. Oftentimes, they require customization, and hence, the need for logistics service providers to hire development agencies to build bespoke customizations and internal tools on top of these systems to make them easier to work with. An alternative these companies resort to is to build an internal system from scratch to fit their business needs. However, such an undertaking is long, costly, and is oftentimes a distraction from their core business. ‚öíÔ∏è Solution Reform is the sweet spot between buying a generic off-the-shelf TMS and building one in-house. Our APIs and pre-built components allow logistics service providers to build the modern transportation management system they need - faster, better, and without the maintenance overhead. Our first product is an AI-powered API suite that allows logistics service providers to build custom automations for mundane tasks related to their TMS. Our APIs are used to power automation use cases including: üö¢ Shipment and quote creation üëÆ Customs clearance filing üè≠ Warehouse order intake üßæ Invoice reconciliation ‚öôÔ∏è How it works Eliminate manual document analysis: Our customizable AI-powered data extraction API, purpose-built for the logistics industry, allows you to extract data with high accuracy from incoming emails and documents including commercial invoices, BOLs, packing lists, and more.

Build beautiful interfaces: Our headless UI components allow you to embed our APIs directly in your products and customer-facing dashboards.

Companies use Resonance as a one-stop shop for campaign creation, intelligent experimentation/prioritization, analytics, and impression management to boost net revenue retention following user onboarding. Schedule a demo or get in contact. The Team: I used to work as a SWE at Dropbox, DoorDash, and Microsoft. In particular, I helped build a similar platform to Resonance at Dropbox that generated $100 million ARR. I wanted to start Resonance because 1) I felt there were many ways to improve that particular tool and 2) I wanted to bring that tool to other companies that need it but don‚Äôt have the bandwidth to build it themselves. The Problem: For companies that depend on product-led growth (primarily consumer/SMB/startup-centric companies), their website remains their most valuable marketing channel. Post-user onboarding, these companies rely on in-product messaging to drive feature adoption so they can retain users. Unfortunately, this sort of strategy only works at scale, and there are many challenges in doing so. Below are some non-trivial functionalities that modern companies require to launch effective campaigns with velocity: Solving this problem is crucial, as millions in ARR is left on the table if companies cannot properly scale their in-product feature discovery/awareness/education. Companies like Dropbox that have built tooling to address the above challenges have generated up to $100 million ARR from the increased user retention. The Solution: Solving this problem requires building a centralized system where any stakeholder (technical or non-technical) can effortlessly launch campaigns to drive in-product feature adoption. Holistic assessment of campaign performance, global impression management, and optimized campaign targeting can only work at scale if there is a single system that serves as a repository for all campaigns and governs campaign creation. Resonance addresses this by providing a central platform where developers and non-developers can both easily launch in-product feature adoption campaigns within minutes, with the above functionalities provided out of the box.

In 2024 alone, $20M in fines are estimated for these building owners. If no action is taken, the fines are expected to increase to over $85M per year by 2030, with over 70% of buildings being non-compliant. üí∏ These fines will continue to rise as emissions thresholds become more stringent over time. Consequently, investments to improve critical building infrastructure have grown substantially, along with the need for subsidies. Consolidated Edison (the largest utility in New York) alone has deployed over $2B in subsidies over the last 4 years! üí°üè¢ Contractors in NYC often spend hours researching the latest requirements and regulations to submit incentive applications, which are often not done correctly. As a result, a contractor may promise a certain amount of incentives to a customer but potentially deliver a completely different amount. This volatility in subsidy money is problematic for contractors who focus on delivering the best pricing and service to their clients. Because subsidy programs are often tied to government entities, contractors and building owners are interested in understanding how to ‚Äústack‚Äù incentives, but are deterred by the required reading to understand how to do so. üìö‚ùóÔ∏è",

Contractors no longer need to spend hours emailing or calling incentive programs, wondering when they'll hear back or if they did anything wrong! By using AI to understand regulatory constraints, we accurately identify the best incentives and provide a comprehensive list of required documentation. üìù More time and money back in our contractors' pockets! We constantly update our software to ensure the most up-to-date information, so users remain worry-free. üòå Contractors can rest assured they are submitting the right paperwork to maximize their clients‚Äô incentives!

Hey everyone! We're Max and Arhan, founders of Rove, and we're thrilled to introduce the first travel credit card for young adults. Our journeys began at Wharton and Harvard, where we built ventures around specialized Bluetooth software to connect people at events and a B2B edtech recruiting platform for schools and startups. We scaled our ventures by day and slept on planes by night, traveling the world for free. Arhan and Max Despite travel-hacking our way to over 50 countries, none of our friends could do the same. The barriers? Stringent credit requirements based on outdated underwriting algorithms (FICO), ludicrous fees, and antiquated software systems turned the dream of free travel into a complicated puzzle. We may have been able to hack the system, but we always wished for one that didn‚Äôt need to be hacked and rewarded users by default instead.",
        "The Problem: Gaps in Accessibility and Usability": "Right now, the travel credit card market fails to serve the people who want to travel the most. Existing cards are like computers were in the early 2000s: they work, but they‚Äôre expensive, many people can‚Äôt access them, and even those who can struggle to use them without help. We‚Äôre building the iPhone of travel cards‚Äîone that‚Äôs easy to use, readily accessible, and seamlessly intuitive. These two market inefficiencies create one of the best opportunities in consumer credit in decades.",
        "Our Solution: Rove": "Rove is here to democratize reward travel, finally offering the first-ever no-annual-fee travel card for Gen Z. We use advanced algorithms and data aggregation systems to underwrite users in a radically more accessible way. By using people‚Äôs cash flow from connecting to their banks, as opposed to outdated data points like mortgages and decades of credit history, we can more accurately underwrite an entirely untapped demographic of users. But we didn't stop there‚Äîwe want reward travel to not only be available to young adults but easy to use too. Our platform introduces the first-ever portal for direct redemption of airline loyalty deals, making the process of traveling the world for free as effortless as it should be. With our alliance of partner airlines, the average Gen Z spender can earn a free annual trip overseas.

This often leaves users stuck with impersonal and long FAQ-style responses in small chat windows, often missing the help they actually need. Internal teams might see some early wins with a public LLM + RAG setup, but that progress usually hits a wall fast.

        "What are safety certifications, and who needs them?": "Building industrial machinery that can hurt someone, like robot arms and autonomous trucks? Your customers will mandate T√úV safety certification per particular ISO and IEC standards! Building small appliances that plug into the grid?

        "Problem üíî": "Over 6.5 million people in the US suffer from heart failure, which is when the heart can no longer pump blood efficiently to the rest of the body. As the disease progresses, symptoms get worse, quality of life tanks, and hospital time skyrockets. It‚Äôs terrible for patients and their loved ones, as well as a huge burden to the healthcare system. Over 90% of symptoms and hospitalizations are driven by fluid buildup around the body (think: fluid in the lungs ‚Üí patient can‚Äôt breathe ‚Üí hospital). Standard of care medications to manage fluid hasn‚Äôt changed in over 60 years, have adverse side effects, require significant provider time, and become ineffective over time. As a result, patients are trapped in a cycle: fluid builds up, symptoms worsen, hospitalization, discharge, repeat. Post-hospitalization, the survival rate is similar to some stage 4 cancers ‚Äì only 50% at 2 years ‚Äì and reduces with each admission.",
        "Approach üéØ": "We are taking a brand new approach by harnessing the body‚Äôs own fluid management mechanisms to remove excess fluid, alleviate symptoms, and reduce hospitalizations. With the heart not pumping blood as well as it should be, it causes backups in the blood vessels (like a highway when there‚Äôs construction). This forces fluid with important nutrients to leak out (detour) into the interstitial space, which is the space between organs and tissues. Normally, this fluid is collected and brought back to the bloodstream by the lymphatic system (a parallel highway with roads all over the body). However, the lymphatic system is overwhelmed by the extra fluid produced in heart failure due to the backups (when Maps reroutes everyone and the seemingly better alternative also has traffic). Without any other way out, fluid is trapped in the interstitial space, leading to the symptoms behind hospitalizations, such as swelling and chest pain depending on where the fluid is stuck. Our technology ‚Äòuntaps‚Äô the fluid stuck in the interstitial space by offloading the lymphatic system so that it can work more efficiently (like opening up more lanes to reduce traffic). With our one-time procedure, minimally invasive lymphatic offloading (MILO) provides long-term treatment and breaks the fluid overload hospitalization cycle for patients.",

        "Shiboleth: Automating consumer lending compliance": "TLDR: Lending companies use us to flag compliance violations for customer interactions and create the first drafts of the reports for the government. üöÄ Shiboleth‚Äôs Y Combinator offer: We are so excited about our technology and the launch üî•. If you are a financial institution and want to check the work of your QA team or auditor shiboleth.ai/#ycdeal, or send an email to founders@shiboleth.ai to receive a free audit of up to 20,000 calls. ‚Äî üëã Hello everyone, we are Esty and Bivu! We are building Shiboleth. If you saw a recent Garry Tan‚Äôs tweet about bookface launch live, that was us :). We were chosen as one of the top products based upon ‚Äúvotes from batch and YC alumni‚Äù. Esty previously worked in the intersection of compliance and conversational intelligence. And Bivu has a decade-long experience in NLP and AI. Together, we are excited to innovate in the regulatory compliance sector, an area that is long due for innovation. We believe that automating compliance can enable smaller financial institutions to exist in the long term. ‚ùå The Problem: Consumer lending is very litigious and consequently, it is heavily regulated: agencies such as CFPB, FDIC, and OCC impose a lot of intentionally ambiguous regulations. Currently, the audits are extremely manual. Even with a large team of auditors, they can only check a fraction of the calls‚Äîsometimes as low as 2% which means that violations can be missed. Often, there is ‚Äújust enough ambiguity‚Äù that the calls and communication warrant manual reviews. This is problematic because an internal audit system might not suffice for compliance purposes. ü§î How does it work?: Shiboleth automatically flags compliance violations in customer interactions. It does this by syncing with the companies' runbooks, using advanced LLMs and NLP to parse relevant regulations. Our extensive database of public reviews, CFPB complaints, and enforcement actions helps us identify the most enforceable regulations and recommend appropriate mitigation actions. You can check out the demo below. üå§Ô∏èWho Can Use Us: Our solution is designed for financial institutions, including banks, fintech companies, and non-bank lenders, that are looking to streamline their lending compliance processes and reduce costs. We are currently working with lending institutions but would be interested in hearing adjacent use cases üì´ If you want to be part of our beta, introduce us to new use cases, or just geek out Dodd-Frank in general, please free to reach out to founders@shiboleth.ai.",

We automate data entry, requesting quotes, comparing quotes, and issuing purchase orders. Our customers save dozens of hours a week spent on repetitive manual tasks. üë¨ Team We met five years ago while studying at the CDTM in Munich. Most recently, Berni worked as a full-stack engineer at Tesla on the Autopilot team, whilst Raban finished his engineering master‚Äôs at Stanford. At Tesla, Berni built tons of internal tooling and saw the supply chain inefficiencies firsthand. During the batch, Raban worked as a purchasing manager for one of our customers. üåã Problem Supply chain data is spread across multiple platforms, such as ERPs, custom spreadsheets, and email inboxes, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of visibility. Supply Chain Managers spend hours each week searching through emails and spreadsheets to track the status of parts procurement, from request to quote to award. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors and delays. For example, changes in production schedules require Supply Chain Managers to follow up with all suppliers individually to adjust their purchase orders. Quotes that aren‚Äôt used are lost in the abyss of email inboxes. Suppliers are reluctant to upload quotes to yet another portal and often fail to notify about delays, leading to costly production standstills. üöõ Solution Soff connects suppliers, parts, and quotes into a single platform. We integrate with ERPs and email to automate supplier communication, send RFQs, and issue purchase orders. We turn unstructured email and PDFs into SQL-ready data, injecting quotes directly into the ERP system. We eliminate the need for manual data entry and dedicated supplier portals, thus increasing supplier response rates. Our platform stores quote data, ensuring no loss of information when switching suppliers or moving from single-source to dual-source. It also tracks parts from the initial request through to the final receipt, providing a complete overview for supplier management. Soff enables manufacturers to deliver higher-quality products faster. Companies like SpaceX (Warpdrive), Rivian (Basecamp), and Apple (Incline) spend millions on building their in-house supply chain tools‚Äîwe bring that level of efficiency to any manufacturer. ‚ù§Ô∏è How you can help If you work in Supply Chain or work(ed) at a manufacturing company we‚Äôd love to connect.

        "What is the core problem you are solving? Why is this a big problem? What made you decide to work on it?": "Hundreds of terabytes of weather data are collected from satellites, ground stations, airplanes and weather balloons every day. A typical weather satellite costs more than $100 million to launch, and the US National Weather Service spends over a billion dollars a year just on its sparse network of weather balloon stations. A small handful of organizations then pipe that data into billion-dollar supercomputers to run the world‚Äôs most expensive physics simulations four times a day. Despite this cost, there are still places in the US where we don't know what the temperature is going to be two days from now. And for the rest of the world that lacks adequate weather infrastructure? There‚Äôs always the weather rock. AI models are upending the expensive physics simulations. These models are more accurate, running at higher resolutions for a fraction of the cost. But, like most AIs, weather models are hungry for data, and the reality is that most of the world isn‚Äôt covered despite the costly infrastructure.This is because direct observation (as opposed to satellite observation) is both incredibly impactful but also incredibly expensive. This cost leaves most of the Earth without in-situ observations. Oceans have especially poor coverage, and no matter how good your model is, you still need to know what‚Äôs happening over the Pacific today to predict the weather in SF tomorrow. Sorcerer is deploying a global network of low-cost, persistent weather drones to provide real-time data in previously unreachable locations. Our system collects 30x more observations than the entire global observation infrastructure at 1% the cost. We use this data to train a weather model that‚Äôs already competitive with best-in-class traditional weather prediction, while being 10,000x cheaper.",

We aim to launch servicing stations in Low Earth Orbit in 2025 and expand to Geostationary Orbit, the Moon, and Mars by 2030. \"Helping space explorers go \"where no man has gone before\" - Captain James T. Kirk :) _ _ Hi, everyone. We are Ashi Dissanayake and Reza Fetanat, the team behind Spaceium. Here's a brief introduction: Ashi is an Aerospace Engineer specializing in Orbital Mechanics and rocket propulsion. Ashi has worked on real-time simulation models for uncrewed return missions to asteroids and on NASA-related aerodynamics projects. Reza is also a space enthusiast and a Mechanical Engineer specializing in Robotics, structures, and Cryogenics. Reza has worked on revitalizing the LR-101 engine, which was used on Atlas, Thor, and Delta launch vehicles. We first met while leading the University of Ottawa's rocketry team, where we built high-powered rockets to send scientific payloads to different altitudes. In our spare time, we enjoyed working together to build rockets in the backyard, sometimes leading to interesting experiences with backyard fires. üî• Throughout our careers, we've noticed the constraints on space missions due to the lack of ability to refuel or repair spacecraft in orbit. The current solutions are costly, and a centralized location where spacecraft can refuel and repair is a massive necessity. We are on a mission to build the missing piece of space infrastructure that connects the space superhighway, Just like how service stations were built on Earth back in the day!",
        "The problem": "All spacecraft and space missions face a standard set of challenges. Fuel is a limited and difficult resource to transport. In the event of a significant issue, spacecraft cannot be repaired in space. These challenges have significantly hindered efficiency in current space missions and have been a substantial obstacle in humanity's quest to explore space further. Unlike a road trip where refueling is common and convenient, spacecraft face a unique challenge. Spacecraft cannot refuel along the way. Instead, they must carry all the fuel required for the mission from Earth. An overwhelming 85% - 95% of the launch weight is fuel on a typical launch vehicle, with 80-90% burned off to reach orbit. üöÄ As a result, spacecraft that transport loads in space (space tugs) can only perform, on average, 25% as many missions as they're technically capable of due to the absence of refueling in space. üõ∞Ô∏è Furthermore, even if a spacecraft wanted to carry additional fuel, it is not easy. Current spacecraft require cryogenic fuels such as liquid oxygen, methane, and liquid hydrogen, which must be stored and transferred at extremely low temperatures of -285¬∞F. ü•∂ Environmental factors in space, such as heat and radiation, increase the temperature of these fuels, causing them to boil off (vaporize). In addition, there is no current solution for spacecraft repair. This means that today's spacecraft must operate flawlessly to maximize efficiency, which is only sometimes the case. For instance, Eutelsat Communications' satellites experienced power loss mid-mission with no option for repair, resulting in a $30 million revenue loss. With Spaceium's multifunction robotic arm, the communication satellite could have been fixed. üõ†Ô∏è",
        "Solution": "Automated servicing stations in space üåéüöÄüõ∞Ô∏è Our primary solution aims to improve space missions' efficiency by addressing refueling challenges. The developed cryogenic fuel storage and transfer technology is designed to store fuel without any boil-off for multiple years in space. As a result, spacecraft can now refuel in space, carry more payload, and travel longer distances. Two fundamental principles guide our proprietary Zero Boil Off (ZBO) technology. Our cryogenic storage system is not only efficient but also highly scalable. Our current cooling system is 65% more efficient than any other cooling system, and our scalable storage system can store up to 30 metric tons of fuel, making it adaptable to a wide range of space missions and requirements. After successfully addressing the challenge of transporting large amounts of space fuel, we turned our attention to developing technology for delivering this fuel to spacecraft in space. This is achieved through the use of a multifunction robotic arm. This advanced arm can securely dock with incoming spacecraft and initiate the fuel transfer. The fluid system built within the arm allows the transfer of different fuel types through the robotic arm. The built-in thermal system ensures that fuel is transferred to the customer's spacecraft at the correct temperature without any boil-off issues associated with cryogenic fuels in space. Additionally, the same robotic arm is versatile enough to handle non-cryogenic fuels as well, providing a comprehensive solution for refueling spacecraft in space. In addition to safe and efficient fuel transfer, the robotic arm is equipped with an interchangeable end effector designed for in-space repairs. In-space repairs are achieved through a fully automated robotic arm that can retrieve tools from a stored \"toolbox\" within the system. This innovative feature ensures that even in the event of a significant issue, spacecraft can be repaired in space, minimizing the risk of mission failure and maximizing mission efficiency. Our vision is to transform the space industry. Starting in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), our servicing infrastructure will progressively expand to encompass Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO), the moon, and eventually Mars. We are on a mission to empower space missions to go further, explore more, and achieve what was once deemed impossible. Who can benefit from our service stations in space",

If you are a utility or community-scale developer, book a call with us to learn more. üîå The Problem We are in the midst of a generational energy transition, with solar deployment expanding at an annualized rate of roughly $500B globally, and the Inflation Reduction Act unleashing another $400B in federal funding. To meet the soaring demand for clean energy, the US must build an equivalent amount of clean generation by 2035 to the total electricity supplied by all sources today. Despite this rapid deployment, utility-scale clean energy developers often spend months assessing and preparing their projects for financing and construction due to varying policies, interconnection, and permitting requirements across jurisdictions. This pre-construction phase is an error-prone and manual effort of researching and aggregating data across thousands of PDFs, websites, and maps. Many developers find themselves poring over 1000-page documents, engaging expensive consultants, or focusing on a limited number of jurisdictions. Through hundreds of conversations with developers, we consistently hear that navigating this \"complex patchwork of jurisdictions, where every state is a snowflake,\" is a major obstacle. ‚ú® Enter Spark With Spark, developers can identify requirements, risks, and incentives by leveraging our curated dataset. They can now screen prospective projects in seconds, not weeks.

By refining the data specifically for this industry, Spark introduces a new way for developers to navigate through otherwise disparate and cumbersome information. These insights are then precisely mapped to individual counties and parcels of land, accelerating the development process significantly. However, Spark‚Äôs capabilities extend beyond location diligence and requirement aggregation. Our goal is to re-imagine the development workflow, enabling developers to drastically reduce the time dedicated to mundane tasks such as research, documentation, and portfolio management. One of our customers, an industry veteran with nearly 20 years of experience, said ‚ÄúI see this tool as my Jarvis.‚Äù Our mission is to empower developers to prioritize human interactions and make strategic decisions about where to invest millions of dollars to electrify the nation‚Äôs grid ‚Äî not the manual, back office work. ü™Ñ The (Dream) Team Tae built software while sitting inside the Model 3 factory at Tesla, wrote payment systems that processed millions in EV sales as a founding engineer at Lucid Motors‚Äô commerce team, and helped Gen Z find love at Tinder. Julia was an engineering manager on the team that automated fraud alerts and dispute filing at Brex. She also built search and cloud infrastructure at Apple and Microsoft and bankrolled her passion for crypto through hackathon prizes on nights and weekends. Hailing from S√£o Paulo, Brazil, where we lived ten minutes apart after our parents immigrated from Korea and China, we embarked on our American dream at 18 for undergraduate degrees in STEM at Georgia Tech and Brown University.

        "Spherecast ‚Äì Inventory copilot for multi-channel brands": "Spherecast is an inventory copilot supporting multi-channel brands with their inventory decisions. ‚ùå The problem As soon as brands go multi-channel, e.g. enter a marketplace or are placed at offline retailers, they face new complexities when it comes to planning demand. Besides that, scaling into multiple channels often entails adding new warehouse locations through the supply chain, be it by sourcing raw materials by yourself or adding FBA as an outbound fulfiller. This is accompanied by rising logistics costs and inventory constraints (such as the low inventory level fee of Amazon or expiration date requirements for sales channels). The combination of these aspects leaves supply chain managers with a sheer amount of different constraints to handle ‚Äì often in very large spreadsheets. This leads to inventory distortion costs ‚Äì the cost of stockouts and overstock ‚Äì which is a $1.8 trillion USD problem for retailers worldwide. ‚úÖ The solution Spherecast combines demand planning, replenishment and inventory optimization in one platform. We connect to shop systems and ERPs automatically. With the platform, brands can automatically get: A library of machine learning forecasts per product and channel to optimize forecast accuracy combined with a collaborative environment to plan with multiple stakeholders. Replenishment optimization, considering With that, we believe inventory management should transform into inventory optimization for everyone. üöÄ Our mission We want to create a world where stockouts do not exist anymore. Imagine any product at the right place, at any time ‚Äî enabled by Spherecast. üôè Our ask If you happen to know supply chain managers at multi-channel e-commerce brands ‚Äì we‚Äôd love to chat!

Their documentation is hard to navigate, with multiple edge cases and data inconsistencies have severe business consequences. This makes CRM integration complex, time consuming and costly.

We fix that. ü•µ PROBLEM: Companies selling physical products struggle with accounting and inventory operations. Current bookkeeping methods rely heavily on manual input and are often disconnected from accurate inventory data. This leads to mistakes in important financial figures like cost of goods sold (COGS), inventory value, margins, and cash flow. As a result, businesses spend a lot of time and money only to gain an inaccurate picture of their financial health. These inaccuracies lead to poor budgeting decisions, loan rejections, failed fundraising, non-compliance, and frequent cash flow crises. üòç OUR SOLUTION: A powerful AI accounting agent built specifically for companies selling physical products. Our platform automates bookkeeping and completes a variety of crucial product operations tasks such as calculating COGS, optimizing POs, and conducting contribution margin analysis with only a few clicks. All financial and inventory data is connected and written back to QBO or your ERP, eliminating financial statement errors, saving dozens of hours per month, and thousands on accounting costs. üí° THE INSPIRATION: As the founder of Robin Golf, Peter encountered this problem frequently.

Think of it as the Stripe of embedded warranties enabling any merchant to offer an Apple Care-style warranty program for every product ranging from smartphones to mattresses. SMBs (< $100M sales) cannot offer warranties due to insurers' high premium requirements. Larger merchants face prolonged onboarding times of over six months and need to build internal tools and support teams to manage warranty operations. SureBright eliminates these barriers, enabling merchants of any size to offer warranties in minutes while reducing the cost to zero. Supporting all sales channels, including major e-commerce platforms, websites, marketplace sales, and brick-and-mortar, SureBright automates every step of the warranty distribution process.

        "SynsoryBio: Therapeutics that sense-and-respond to disease": "TL;DR At SynsoryBio, we engineer \"if-then\" conditional logic into protein medicines, meaning only if the protein drug senses a disease marker, then it turns on. We are applying this technology to clinically tested, but highly toxic cancer immunotherapies to make them safer and more effective. Who we are/Team: SynsoryBio was founded by brother scientists, Elliot and Nathan, who both hold PhDs in biomedical engineering. The founders gained expertise in synthetic biology at Boston University, Harvard Medical School, and industrial biotech, where they authored numerous high-impact journal publications and are inventors on several patent filings. SynsoryBio harnesses this expertise to create next-generation therapeutics that understand where they are in the body and only act at the site of disease. The Problem: The most potent therapeutics suffer from safety issues and dose limitations, impeding their development and overall efficacy. This isn‚Äôt surprising because most therapeutics are delivered systemically and are active throughout the body even though the underlying disease is localized to a certain tissue. For example, immunotherapies to treat cancer show great promise but usually exhibit dose limitations, especially in combination, which prevents the development of potent immune stimulators and/or mitigates clinical efficacy. The Synsory Solution: We are developing next-generation protein therapeutics that have synthetic sensing functions so that they know where they are in the body and only act at disease tissue. Our approach is highly flexible, allowing us to design protein therapeutics that conditionally activate upon sensing virtually any specified biomolecule.

        "Tamarind Bio: API for scalable bioinformatics": "TL;DR In addition to our no-code web platform (https://www.tamarind.bio/), Tamarind Bio now offers an API for computational teams to use cutting-edge bioinformatics tools for drug discovery without setting up any computing infrastructure or scaling up GPUs. We provide protein structure prediction (e.g. AlphaFold), protein design(RFdiffusion), and molecular docking tools at large scale and easily integrated into your workflow. Additionally, we deploy your custom models for internal use, provide virtual screening services, and provide pipelines to feed the results of models as input to the next downstream tool. The Problem Computational biology thrives on doing in silico experiments at large scales. However, it‚Äôs tedious to allocate tens/hundreds of GPUs for compute-heavy machine learning tools, make sure they are running as intended, and analyze disparate results. Whether it‚Äôs AlphaFold for protein structure prediction, RFdiffusion for binder design or DiffDock for small molecule docking, deploying these tools scalably and connecting them to downstream pipelines steals time away from developing models and doing better science. The Solution Tamarind is launching an API for state-of-the-art computational tools in protein design, structure prediction, and docking. Simply submit your job and check back to receive your result. Download these results, keep them in S3, or generate an analysis. Tamarind now integrates seamlessly with existing computational workflows: we‚Äôll work with you to deploy your custom models and pipelines or run on your existing cloud computing infrastructure. We are Deniz and Sherry! We met as undergrads at Stanford, where we studied Computer Science and conducted comp bio research, experiencing the inefficiencies of using bioinformatics tools firsthand. Today, 1000+ scientists from institutions including Stanford, Harvard, and Oxford regularly use Tamarind to accelerate their work, as well as many YC companies. Let us handle the DevOps, while you focus on your science! Asks Try Tamarind out! Use our web platform now or email us to learn more about using the API.

COVID has left US offices half as full as they were in 2019 and resulted in landlords sitting on $500B+ in losses.

A developer can build and debug in a CPU-only dev machine, then scale to a massive cluster with one command. This flexibility saves time spent configuring instances and cost of paying for idle compute during development. In the background, our technology dramatically cuts CapEx for cloud providers. It does this by: 1) Placing multiple workloads on a single GPU with dynamic memory sharing, similar to vCPUs on AWS, improving utilization 2) Allowing CPU-only instances to share pooled GPU resources rather than dedicated cards that can't be accessed by other machines, further improving utilization GPU virtualization also saves OpEx by reducing IT and procurement processes required to get developers access to GPUs.

Using our app, the advisor can see their upcoming meetings, for which they can prepare by viewing a holistic profile about the client and even asking natural language questions. Once in the meeting, our app uses state-of-the-art AI technology to transcribe, summarize, generate action items, and draft follow-up emails. Finally, our powerful integrations with the rest of the advisors‚Äô tech stack also allow us to initiate workflows and send tasks and notes to other systems.

Figure 1: 94% of Physicians Report Delayed Patient Care due to Prior Authorization (Source: American Medical Association Survey of 1,000 Doctors) As you can imagine, insurance carriers are incentivized to delay and/or deny approval as much as they can. Some carriers are so egregious that they‚Äôre incurring fines in the tens of millions for morbidly delaying the care of sick patients.

        "TokenOwl ü¶â AI TurboTax for the next generation of crypto": "TL;DR: TokenOwl modernizes tax reporting for a new generation of crypto traders. DeFi users and high-volume memecoin flippers can now use an AI assistant to calculate taxes with greater accuracy and find trends in their trade history. ‚Äî Hey everyone, we‚Äôre Colin and Amith. We‚Äôre building TokenOwl to save traders time and money. üí∞ The problem: Current crypto tax software solutions work fine for traditional buy-and-hold crypto users with dozens or hundreds of transactions per year, but they aren‚Äôt built for DeFi users and high-volume memecoin traders. They tend to mislabel these transactions which can lead to capital gains calculations being incorrect. The only way to fix such mistakes is for the user to spend hours‚Äìsometimes even days with enough transactions‚Äìtroubleshooting their tax report. They also cost too much for users with thousands of transactions. As the IRS increases scrutiny on digital assets, reporting crypto capital gains and income accurately will be crucial. The culprit ($WIF): Our solution: LLMs are really good at processing large amounts of nuanced data (like complex DeFi transactions). We are building a solution that leverages LLMs to reduce breakage when generating tax reports and minimize the time spent on troubleshooting/understanding transaction logs. Users can also query their logs directly with natural language, to unlock new possibilities in analysis and review. This makes for a smooth experience for both experienced traders and occasional investors who need help parsing their portfolios. Why now: Users migrating to low fee chains like Solana and Ethereum L2s means way more people are trading at high volumes. Solana DEX volume alone has consistently been $2-3B daily in recent weeks. These traders are going to have a very tough time sorting this out with existing solutions (not to mention paying hundreds to thousands of dollars). The next million crypto users will look more like these DeFi farmers and rapid memecoin flippers than Bitcoin hodlers. They need a new way to calculate taxes and understand their portfolio. How it works: Connect your wallets and exchanges just as you would with a traditional tax reporting solution. You can then immediately start asking our AI assistant questions in natural language. This can be anything from reconciliation for tax purposes (‚ÄúIs the transaction on June 12th where I provided ETH and USDC to a liquidity pool not considered a taxable event?‚Äù) to higher level understanding of your portfolio (‚ÄúWhy was June such an outlier for my capital gains?‚Äù). Once everything looks good, you can export your tax summary for TurboTax. About us: Colin was previously a technical lead at IncQuery. He studied decentralized finance under economist Cam Harvey at Duke. Amith was previously at UChicago pursuing a Master‚Äôs in computer science, and a developer at Amazon before that. Having traded crypto at high volume personally, we‚Äôve dreaded tax season every year because of all the manual review it entails. We are building this to enable compliance for DeFi users, high-volume traders, new investors, and even businesses that want to explore managing their finances in DeFi responsibly.

        "OUR SCIENCE": "We‚Äôve discovered that cancers are addicted to a molecule called ‚Äòheme‚Äô. Heme, which is well-known as the central component of ‚Äòhemoglobin‚Äô, is used by the mitochondria to make energy. Cancers ‚Äòsteal‚Äô free-floating heme from the blood to fuel their rapid growth. Our patented drugs starve cancer by removing this heme that cancer cells need, but normal cells don‚Äôt. We‚Äôve shown in animals that our drugs are highly effective for multiple cancers, without affecting healthy cells, even at the highest doses. Also, by starving tumors, we make them weaker and more susceptible to existing cancer treatments, like radiation, chemo, and immunotherapies. The body has a natural system to clean up this free-floating heme, but it gets overwhelmed by cancer. Our drugs essentially amplify the body‚Äôs natural heme removal system. We let nature do most of the work ‚Äì our drugs are built from proteins that have evolved over millennia to be perfect at capturing heme. Importantly, heme is the exact same molecule across all mammals, meaning the results we see in animals have a higher chance of translating to humans. We‚Äôre starting with lung cancer, with a lead drug advancing to first-in-human trials next year. Because multiple types of cancers have this same vulnerability, our lead drug could potentially be used for lots of cancer types and become a standard-of-care treatment.",

Today's spacecraft power systems are not capable enough to support both the current and next-generation mission concepts, leading satellite manufacturers to painful trade-offs: limiting additional hardware or increasing system size to get more power. With reduced capabilities, companies lose their technological advantage. With increased size, manufacturing costs are higher, risk of schedule delays is greater, and go-to-market is slower due to fewer spacecraft launches. These trade-offs are fundamental limitations of spacecraft design and space economics. While space-rated solar panels are thin, efficient, and can be foldable, batteries take up significant useful volume (up to 30% in small spacecraft) and are vastly less capable than the latest terrestrial equivalents.",
        "Solution": "Traditional spacecraft walls are purely structural, serving little functional purpose after launch while occupying valuable space. Our Voltaris 1 module replaces these walls, providing structural support and energy storage simultaneously. This allows satellite manufacturers to double their energy capacity without increasing size or gain 15-30% more useful volume at the same power budget. Key Features:",

The autonomous control of traffic lights gives back to both city officials and their citizens their most valuable resource - time. ‚Äî Hi everyone, we‚Äôre Everett, Luke, and Brian, the founders of XTraffic. Why Now? The combination of rapidly advancing technology and smart-city initiatives has created a unique intersection in time where intelligent traffic control is not just possible but affordable. As smart city initiatives are being adopted worldwide, municipalities of all sizes are looking for ways to affordably transition to intelligent infrastructure. XTraffic leverages this trend by providing cities with a scalable, intelligent system that upgrades existing traffic lights into a self-optimizing network. Market Opportunity The global smart city market is projected to reach $3.84 trillion by 2029, with traffic management as a requirement to aid in driving this growth. Urban areas are expanding, and traffic congestion is a major pain point that costs the U.S. more than $70.4 billion in 2023, a 15% increase from 2022. XTraffic is tapping into this immense market opportunity by offering a solution that not only reduces traffic congestion but also enhances safety, reduces emissions, and increases overall quality of life. Why XTraffic? Our system isn‚Äôt just about less traffic; it‚Äôs about smarter use of our infrastructure. XTraffic's approach allows traffic lights to 'talk' to each other, making real-time decisions based on current conditions across an entire network. This holistic view enables our system to adapt dynamically to changing traffic patterns, emergencies, and other factors - this significantly reduces delays and optimizes traffic flow across entire cities. With our solution, cities can avoid the massive costs of overhauling infrastructure. Instead, they can implement an affordable, flexible system that integrates seamlessly with existing technology. This reduces the barrier to entry and allows for rapid deployment, scaling from single intersections to entire metropolitan areas. Call to Action We‚Äôre excited to be part of Y Combinator, and we‚Äôre looking forward to connecting with cities, investors, and partners who share our vision for smarter, safer, and more efficient urban environments.

Check out our product here: www.yonedalabs.com/yoneda-optimize Who we are We are three University of Cambridge grads combining expertise in Computer Science and Chemistry, with a leader in the field, Prof Scott E Denmark as our advisor. Combined, we have experience working in Bayer, Berkeley AI Research, Jane Street, Optiver and Cisco. Jan ranked top 11 in the International Chemistry Olympiad for 3 years in a row. Problem: There are more than 10M different compounds created each year. Chemists need to figure out how to make them. To do so, they often rely on literature data. Unfortunately, this data almost never contains the exact recipe and the ones out there are often misreported and irreproducible in the lab. This means that chemists still need to frequently rely on their intuition, and when that fails, a potentially life-saving drug might never see the light of day. Solution: Foundation model for chemical reactions We are generating our own dataset of chemical experiments. We will use it to train a powerful model capable of defining good conditions for any organic reaction. We‚Äôve performed feasibility studies on smaller datasets and confirmed our beliefs that if we choose the experiments very carefully, we will be able to cover 3 of the most popular reactions in organic chemistry with only 20k data points. We‚Äôve already created an app that learns from the chemists‚Äô experimental data as they run their reactions in the lab. This allows them to find the optimal conditions in days instead of weeks or months. Our custom algorithms allow the app to run fully offline from the chemist's PC to account for data sensitivity. Additionally, we designed the app to be simple to use so that every chemist can employ state-of-the-art statistics and machine learning in their lab in just a few clicks.

We've just open-sourced Graphiti, a Python library for building temporal Knowledge Graphs using LLMs. https://youtu.be/sygRBjILDn8 Graphiti helps you create and query graphs that evolve over time. Think of a knowledge graph as a network of interconnected facts, such as ‚ÄúKendra loves Adidas shoes.‚Äù Each fact is a ‚Äútriplet, represented by two entities, or nodes (‚ÄùKendra,‚Äù ‚ÄúAdidas shoes‚Äù), and their relationship, or edge (‚Äùloves‚Äù). Knowledge Graphs have been explored extensively for information retrieval. What makes Graphiti unique is its ability to autonomously build a knowledge graph while handling changing relationships and maintaining historical context. At Zep, we build a memory layer for LLM applications. Developers use Zep to recall relevant user information from past conversations without including the entire chat history in a prompt. Accurate context is crucial for LLM applications. If an AI agent doesn't remember that you've changed jobs or confuses the chronology of events, its responses can be jarring or irrelevant, or worse, inaccurate.",
        "Zep‚Äôs Suboptimal Fact Pipeline": "Before Graphiti, our approach to storing and retrieving user ‚Äúmemory‚Äù was, in effect, a specialized RAG pipeline. An LLM extracted ‚Äúfacts‚Äù from a user‚Äôs chat history. Semantic search, reranking, and other techniques then surfaced facts relevant to the current conversation back to a developer for inclusion in their prompt. Unfortunately, this approach became problematic. Reconciling facts from increasingly complex conversations challenged even frontier LLMs such as gpt-4o. We saw incomplete facts, poor recall, and hallucinations. Our RAG search also failed at times to capture the nuanced relationships between facts, leading to irrelevant or contradictory information being retrieved. We tried fixing these issues with prompt optimization but saw diminishing returns on effort. We realized that a graph would help model a user‚Äôs complex world, potentially addressing these challenges.",
        "Building Graphiti": "We were intrigued by Microsoft‚Äôs GraphRAG, which expanded on RAG text chunking with a graph to better model a document corpus. However, it didn't solve our core problem: GraphRAG is designed for static documents and doesn't natively handle temporality. So, we built Graphiti, a temporal Knowledge Graph library, which is designed from the ground up to handle constantly changing information, hybrid semantic and graph search, and scale:",

        "Our ask üì£": "",
        "The problem": "We love designing hardware. But existing design tools are slowing us down. The key reason is that in hardware design, everything is done manually: Electronic schematics are drawn by hand, files are exported through a series of clicks, and circuit boards are validated for weeks on the test bench. When systems become complex, this process becomes hugely time-consuming and error-prone. Imagine writing an entire complex software program using only assembly code. This is what designing hardware feels like today.",
        "The solution": "atopile is a new programming language to describe electronics with code. Instead of drawing the product itself, you can now capture your product requirements using atopile source code. From there, our compiler builds and validates the product manufacturing files for you. Not only is this faster and more reliable but it also lets you use advanced software development tools such as code editors, git, GitHub, GitLab, Continuous Integration, and copilot to design hardware. After launching on Hacker News and getting hundreds of downloads, we have seen a glimpse of an exciting future: our users have created new designs in atopile, used GitHub for version control, shared their work on our Package Manager, and used Continuous Integration to generate their manufacturing files automatically. Our most active users have also made contributions to our codebase, which we are super thankful for! Early on, we decided to make atopile open-core. Our goal is to create a new industry standard for describing hardware. With an open-core approach, our users have guaranteed access to their code. Our plan is to generate revenue with enterprise-targeted features, in a model similar to GitLab. Our code is on GitHub here and we have up-to-date docs here.",

It turns out installers would love to focus on heat pumps, but they lack the skills and tools to meet the overwhelming demand. These small, fragmented businesses across Europe struggle with scaling their processes and securing growth financing.

Ion also wraps existing design systems to generate modular pieces that are easy to modify and integrate. Ion enables designers to change designs that have already been implemented and automatically shoot out PRs to update the code. This removes significant engineering work and allows the engineers to review rather than write design fixes from scratch. We retain pre-existing changes to the code, so the design changes don‚Äôt mess with written logic. Benefit to team: Engineers view design implementation as rote, monotonous work. So Ion automates that part and allows them to focus on the more interesting aspects that actually drive value - like business logic, front end architecture, and asynchronous data.",

Describe your graphics pipeline using a higher-level abstractions and use renderlet to generate low-level, cross-platform rendering code. With renderlet, developers can easily embed GPU-accelerated 2D and 3D graphics into cross-platform applications.",
        "How it works": "With renderlet, we compile graphics to portable WebAssembly modules and provide a runtime that abstracts away the underlying GPU architecture to the code. Developers can take advantage of modern technologies like WebGPU without having to learn the intricacies of yet another standard. 2D and 3D graphics are fully decoupled from the application and device and can ship decoupled from the applications code in a format that runs anywhere. Renderlet is: Anybody should be able to build interactive applications without having to be a graphics programming expert.",
        "About Us": "Sean Isom previously built developer platforms at Adobe as a Lead Engineer and Sr. Engineering Manager. He helped bring products to the cloud and web using tools like WebAssembly and is currently involved in standardization efforts for WebAssembly GPU support.",
        "What‚Äôs next?": "Our cross-platform rendering engine, wander, is open source: https://github.com/renderlet/wander/ We‚Äôre kicking off with a live demo today of renderlet at Wasm I/O! https://2024.wasmio.tech/sessions/paint-by-numbers-high-performance-drawing-in-wasm/ Want more info on cross-platform graphics?

At a young age, Melvin fell in love with computers and ended up getting his first job as a software engineer at an European unicorn at the age of 14. While in high school, Melvin built and sold software integrations for $150K. After graduation, he served as the Head of Tech at a Stockholm-based e-commerce startup for 2 years, and studied at the top finance school in Northern Europe (SSE) before ultimately dropping out 3 months in to start Reworks.",

        "reworks - the fastest way to integrate with external software": "Hey everyone! We‚Äôre Melvin and Erik from reworks. TL;DR: reworks is the fastest way for agentic AI companies to build integrations with external software. Instead of spending weeks integrating with traditional APIs or writing custom scraping scripts, teams use reworks to build browser-based integrations that don't require any maintenance. For example, we help customers in:",
        "‚ùå The Problem": "Teams building agentic AI today spend up to half of their time on integrations with external software. For example, a team building AI scheduling software for healthcare might have to integrate with 10s or even 100s of EHR systems - wasted time that could instead be spent on improving the core product. Additionally, many legacy systems lack official APIs, leading to developers building custom, browser-based integrations. Writing the scraping scripts is time-consuming and often results in highly unreliable and heavy maintenance. Underlying UI changes, such as an innocent popup, can completely break integrations.",
        "üèÜ The Solution": "With reworks, teams can record workflows in any browser-based software and turn them into reliable API endpoints in minutes. Integrations are built by simply recording yourself navigating the software UI and explaining in natural language what the return JSON data should look like. With reworks, you get: To illustrate, here‚Äôs a demo of Melvin building an integration to Amazon in <6 minutes: https://www.tella.tv/video/reworks-demo-1-gufr",
        "üßö Why we started working on this": "reworks started off as an AI assistant for e-commerce customer support. It was all smooth sailing until we started to onboard customers and realized that for each new customer we wanted to onboard, there were several systems that we had to integrate our AI agent with (e.g., ERPs, WMS, and CRMs), each taking weeks to build via traditional APIs. We spoke to over 40 other YC companies building in agentic AI and realized that external integrations are fundamental for the new wave of AI companies, but building them is way more painful than it should be. We‚Äôre on a mission to change that.",
