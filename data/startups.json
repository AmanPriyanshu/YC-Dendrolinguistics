        "problem": "Imagine a law firm is tasked with determining the strength of a patent or set of patent claims. This is an everyday problem for patent attorneys and could be for anything from a patent application to an IP litigation case. To start, the attorneys need to conduct a prior art search. Typically, either: In either case, they have already contributed a massive amount of resources to this project without much validation that they are going in the right direction. With their prior art in hand, the attorneys must evaluate the claims with respect to the art. This involves drafting work products like claim charts, which require several read-throughs of each document to identify and map the relevant language over the course of 20-40 billed hours. By now, the attorneys should have a good idea of the strength of the claims, whether they need to be revised, and whether they may be invalid. What if they haven\u2019t found the invalidating art? They repeat the process. Over and over again, for every patent, for every case. Due diligence can continue almost indefinitely, and it\u2019s only limited by attorney time and client budgets.",

Upon receiving the patent or claims, they find the invalidating prior art and export comprehensive claim charts in seconds! &AI enables both attorneys and inventors to conduct their patent due diligence at a speed, scale, and quality that has never before been possible. In minutes, we can analyze and compare the inventive aspects of thousands of patents, allowing attorneys to spend less time on tedious work and more time developing their arguments.

Below is a plot from the resulting publication. However, MACE is computationally expensive, each of the results from the below plot required 1 week of compute on 8 A100 GPUs. We use diffusion models to accelerate MACE simulations, making them computationally affordable.

Surprisingly, the mining industry is one of the largest scale users of biotech in the world with biomining processes accounting for ~1% of global copper production. Biomining is ultra-low cost, running around ~$1/ton of ore vs ~$7/ton for conventional processes. Unfortunately, while biomining is cheap, it can\u2019t be applied to over 80% of copper ores, leaving vast resources without profitable extraction methods. An estimated 100M tonnes of copper sit today in waste materials and stockpiles with negative unit economics. While a great deal of effort has been spent on optimizing microbial metal extraction processes, very little effort has been spent on optimizing the microbes themselves. To change that, we\u2019re creating new biotech tools and platforms applied directly to the types of biology most relevant to miners.

It turns out the mining industry is one of the largest-scale users of biotech in the world. ~1.2% of copper production in 2019-2020 was done using microbes in a process called \u201cbioleaching.\u201d The basic idea here is to: Stack ore into a giant pile \u2014 think miles long and 100s of feet tall. This pile is called a \u201cheap.\u201d Grow a very unique group of organisms that love acid and use both iron in the rocks and CO2 from the air as food sources. This triggers a series of chemical reactions that ultimately separates the solid copper from the ore into a liquid form. Collect this liquid at the bottom and run a current through it. Then you have pure copper! Miners have been using this process for copper extraction for decades (and in some cases, for other metals like gold, nickel, and cobalt). The process is cleaner and ~7x cheaper than conventional processes. It also produces fewer tailings (mine waste), a growing environmental problem and liability for miners Why isn\u2019t this used everywhere?

We met in high school when we were both 14 and bonded over our interest in coding. Our first project was a cookie-clicker game that we wrote during a sleepover two weeks after meeting for the first time. Nico has since received a Masters in Econometrics from the University of Cambridge with a research focus on the mathematical theory of Machine Learning algorithms (Random Forests, DBSCAN). Lukas holds a Masters from ETH Z\u00fcrich, where he trained robot dogs at the Robotics Systems Lab, using the latest Machine Learning models. During his Masters, he wrote the official ETH Z\u00fcrich RSL open-source Reinforcement Learning \u201calgorithms\u201d library. His Master's thesis was published in the highest-ranked Robotics conference (ICRA) this year. There is a lot of cheap, high-quality, unused compute sitting around gpulist.ai alone lists over $1bn in unrealized contract value. These are the latest Nvidia models in cutting-edge data centers, with Infiniband interconnect and perfect internet. They are cheap because nobody books them. Meanwhile, research labs and AI companies are looking for cheap, high-quality compute but will not go through unknown, unclear websites and the associated sales process. We allow them to book pre-configured GPU instances on-demand at wholesale prices that they would normally need to negotiate. We\u2019ve built software that makes idle GPUs in data centers accessible and super simple to book and use via our website. Data-centers and AI companies with idle compute have the option to list instances on the spot market as soon as they are available, it takes 5 minutes to set up. Unlike other solutions, our software enables fractional use of GPU boxes, so 8 GPUs can be rented out to 8 different people. Other options are either expensive, booked out, or a pain to use We know how inconvenient current solutions are because we\u2019ve dealt with them, both at university and for the previous iteration of this startup (robotics-related). For example, Lukas, during his time at ETH, was given a blank check by his lab to book GPUs for his research. He spent the entire night with his supervisor going through Google Cloud to scrape together a few GPU instances; Google will only tell you that an H100 is unavailable in Region X after you configured and launched your instance. Plus, they were expensive, with an A100 SXM 40GB at $3.60/gpu/hour (compare this to $1.28 on our site). Solution: GPUDeploy GPUDeploy is a software solution and marketplace for renting GPUs. We have made our site simple, to the point, and opinionated - there are no hurdles between you and booking a GPU. We offer very competitive pricing and ensure that the compute instance you book is reliable and meets our benchmarks. We both have a spot offering and an Airbnb-like experience for long-term bookings. We match your spot request with available compute resources that meet our standards. You can then simply connect to the machine to run your workloads. We launched with a Show HN four weeks ago, which immediately got #1 and stayed on the front page for 2 days. Try it out!

We\u2019re Connor, Vignesh, and Ankit \u2013 the cofounders of Anthrogen (formerly Arctic Capture). This is actually our second Launch YC post of the batch (first one here under the name Arctic Capture) \u2013 we decided we needed a relaunch/rebrand. In our first launch we promised carbon capture with genetically engineered bacteria. In this one, we are happy to tell you that we have exceeded what we originally thought was possible at the beginning of the summer; we\u2019re not just focused on bacterial carbon capture but also on recombinant protein expression and generative protein models \u2013 all coming together under a single unified platform. Polymers are everywhere, we are not very good at creating them sustainably. Current carbon dioxide removal technologies are expensive and/or inefficient. From plastics to fuels to foods to fabrics to carbon stores \u2013 every facet of our lives is defined by polymers. Publicly traded companies live and die by the prices of these carbon chains and with the price of crude oil, inefficient catalytic processes, looming threats of legislation/public pressure around carbon emissions, these companies worth trillions of dollars are in a precarious position. We need a way to produce polymers cheaper, sustainably. Solugen became a $2b startup in 5 years by using sugar instead of oil as a base of these reactions \u2013 is there another source of carbon we can use instead? Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies are also prohibitively expensive \u2013 current high-quality solutions still cost >$1000 per ton of CO2 capture. With more than two-thirds of the Fortune 500 pledging net-zero goals in the next decade, a cost-efficient solution to decarbonization is worth billions. Our solution? We are creating a platform that allows for both CDR and low-cost polymer manufacturing while sidestepping traditional roadblocks of scaling up bacterial cultures using generative models and CRISPR. We\u2019ve figured out a way to make the most productive cyanobacterial species (cyanobacteria were the organisms behind the Great Oxidation Event ~2bn years ago) grow even faster \u2013 to the best of our knowledge, going through the literature on the topic, we have created the fastest photosynthesizing organism alive. We have also determined chemoenzymatic processes from the cyanobacteria\u2019s enzyme output that can create starch from carbon dioxide. We are starting with starch as the quintessential polymer but hope to have a process that is generalizable enough to reapply to other more valuable polymers down the line.

        "setting": "Hello, we\u2019re Alex and Devan, and we\u2019re building the low-cost cruise missiles the United States needs! What we\u2019re building Ares is building a new class of anti-ship cruise missiles. We are going to deliver the capabilities that the DoD wants in a form factor that\u2019s 10x smaller and 10x cheaper. Our missiles will be compatible with existing launch platforms, deliver smaller payloads at high subsonic speeds, and take out ships hundreds of miles away. We\u2019re focusing on ground and ship-launched variants to start but will expand into air-launched versions, as well as versions with extended ranges and different payloads. Why we\u2019re doing this A war with China in the Taiwan Strait would look nothing like what we've seen in Ukraine or the Middle East. Wargames within DoD and military experts are in agreement that the most useful weapons in such a conflict would be long range anti-ship weapons or cruise missiles. The United States is not adequately prepared. In a potential conflict, our stockpiles will run out in weeks, and we currently don\u2019t have the industrial capacity to build at a rate that could win a war, much less deter China. Higher-ups in DoD are waking up to the problem, and generals such as Major General Cameron Holt and officials such as Chairman of the House Select Committee on China Mike Gallagher have echoed this sentiment. Recent conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine have shown that our weapons are too large, too expensive for the wars of today. Existing anti-ship cruise missiles are low-volume, multi-million dollar, 3,000 lb behemoths meant to take out large cruisers and destroyers. But Chinese shipbuilding capability is far superior to ours, and we can\u2019t make enough anti-ship missiles to counter. In addition, huge missiles aren\u2019t needed to take out the smaller corvettes and frigates that make up the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy. And $3M missiles make even less sense to take out swarms of $200k small, unmanned surface vessels. The DoD needs smaller, less expensive cruise missiles, and lots of them! But no one has delivered on that promise yet. How we know how to do this Both of us have worked at multiple defense and munitions startups. Devan is an Army Psychological Operations and Navy combat veteran and has deep experience in operations and business development at well-funded defense startups. Alex was the first engineering hire at an earlier missile startup, built autonomous systems at Rivian and Stanford, and worked on turbojets at CSULB. Where we\u2019re at now We spent the summer building multiple prototypes and flight-testing them in the Mojave. In 11 weeks, we went from starting the company to flight testing with our own design. We are on track to deliver early working missile systems to our first customers by mid-2025. We believe our vision for anti-ship cruise missiles can help fill the munitions gap that the US faces. At Ares, we would never wish for a war to occur. But by helping to rebuild our defense industrial base, we can make sure the United States is prepared to stop a conflict and save countless lives. Our Ask We are looking for extremely talented aerospace engineers to help bring our prototypes to fruition. If you know any aerodynamics, propulsion, or GNC engineers who are interested in building something incredibly cool and want to make a positive difference in geopolitics, please send them our way!",

TL;DR Astro Mechanica has invented a new kind of jet engine \u2013 the Electric Adaptive Engine. Unlike any existing engine, it's efficient at every speed. Because it's efficient at every speed, it can be used in new and different ways. It can launch payloads to orbit 3x cheaper than an all rocket system, or enable a passenger aircraft 3x faster than an airliner. Jet Aircraft Stopped Improving in the 1970s Jet aircraft have powered much of the global economy through trade and commerce since the advent of the Jet Age, yet the technology has not changed foundationally in over 40 years. Modern commercial jets are still using (more or less) the same airframes that were originally designed in the 1970s. The first Boeing 737 flew in April 1967 and the first Airbus A300 flew in October 1972. Jet engines \u2013 which are limited by a trade-off between speed and efficiency \u2013 have similarly only seen incremental improvements. Newer jet engine designs (like the turbofan) are more fuel-efficient, but slower than older ones (like the turbojet). The New Jet Age Powered flight starts with the engine. To change flight, you must change the engine. Astro Mechanica has invented a new type of jet engine that is efficient at every speed. We call it the Electric Adaptive Engine and it is not only more fuel efficient than modern jet engines, but 3x faster. We\u2019ve achieved this by using electric motors to drive the compressor, allowing it to spin at variable speeds and \"adapt\" to its airspeed and combustion cycle. We built our proof-of-concept engine in just two months \u2014 something that would take the typical aerospace company a year to build. We\u2019re now finishing up our first flight engine in just three months using $500k of off-the-shelf hardware. The next step is to build an airframe over the next 6-8 months to use that engine. We\u2019ll then put it all together and demonstrate supersonic flight in 2025. Here\u2019s some photos from that first flight engine build Astro Mechanica\u2019s Master Plan Phase 1: De-risk technology for passenger aircraft certification through applications like space launch Phase 2: Establish manufacturing and operational capacity to offer private flights Phase 3: Scale operational capacity and make supersonic flight affordable Why Are We Starting with Launch? Because it is cheaper, easier, and a regulatory hack to supersonic passenger travel. What Are the Benefits of Launching at Speed? An increase in payload capacity at a lower cost. We can deliver 3.5x more payload capacity by air-launching a rocket at 800 m/s \u2013 that also makes it 3.5x cheaper than launching from the ground.

The Team - David and John B. met in undergrad at the University of Georgia and have been close friends for 12 years. David has a PhD in Computer Science from USC and is an expert in soft-body robotic manipulation. John B. has an MBA from Kellogg and extensive experience in airline ground operations. They founded Azalea Robotics at the intersection of their combined strengths to modernize bag-handling systems at airports. The Problem - Airport baggage handling is broken. It requires an immense amount of back-breaking labor, using decades-old infrastructure at airports, all while passengers increasingly choose to cram everything into a carry-on because they don\u2019t trust airlines to deliver their luggage on time and in one piece. Airlines and airports have an increasingly hard time hiring these workers and are plagued by frequent system outages and customer confusion and complaints during large weather events. The Solution - Robotic systems work around the clock, never get tired and damage your bag, never misidentify bags, and are significantly cheaper to deploy than manual labor. Our technology allows large robotic arms to handle all bag types and intelligently improve with every bag transferred. Check out a sneak peek of our system in action! https://youtu.be/yFtXG44q05A Our Customers - We sell our systems to airports and airlines around the world. Depending on the size of their airport presence (i.e., is this a hub for a given airline?), airlines will either outsource or hire in-house baggage handling for their customers. Airports are typically public entities run by the local city or metropolitan area and can be more or less hands-on with baggage handling, depending on their passenger volume.

These records can be extensive\u2014often comprising thousands of pages (we\u2019ve seen as high as 45,000 pages for one patient!). However, not all of this information is directly relevant to the physician\u2019s specialty or to the questions of the claim, so they spend hours sifting through the records to identify the most pertinent information. PHYSICIANS BEFORE USING BRIGHTERWAY \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f THE SOLUTION \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f Brighterway\u2019s system structures and deduplicates disorganized medical records (PDFs) and breaks them down to content related to a doctor\u2019s specific specialty. So, physicians can see what is most meaningful for them without having to sift through thousands of pages of unimportant text. This saves physicians hours each day. Summaries are created and can be viewed side by side with the original records, so physicians can edit and type directly within the outputs (like a Google Doc) so they don\u2019t have to leave the page when writing notes or a report. PHYSICIANS AFTER USING BRIGHTERWAY ______________________________________________________________________ How can you help? If you have any friends, family, or connections to somebody doing med-legal exams or IME/QME work (or wanting to start doing such work) either as a physician or a medical exam management company (a business that coordinates and manages medical evaluations for a group of physician examiners), send them our way!",

        "problem": "Defects are a universal challenge in manufacturing, particularly with methods like injection molding, die casting, and 3D printing. Factories using these methods frequently retool their lines for different products making it difficult and costly to gather enough data to train defect detection models. Manufacturers strive to ensure that only the highest quality products reach their customers. Avoiding the shipment of defective products not only protects their reputation but also safeguards expensive machinery from damage, maximizes yield by leveraging advanced analytics, and prevents the progression of faulty parts through the production line, which can lead to compounded waste and increased costs. A 2017 study estimates that yield losses account for 44% of sheet metal used in the production of passenger vehicles \u2014 and we want to bring that number down, saving money and the environment. Traditionally, defect detection comes in two flavors: Paying people to check parts is inefficient and a miserable job. Collecting enough labeled data samples to train a model is impractical for rapidly retooled outputs, and the labeling is expensive. This often leaves manufacturers with a critical gap in quality assurance, leading to increased scrap, downtime, and potentially unhappy customers with defective parts.",

I loved being able to maintain my flow state and use a single programming language\u2014one I\u2019d grown quite fond of\u2014for everything. CLIs, tooling scripts, HTTP servers\u2026 if I needed a piece of code, I would find a way to write it in Dart. The ecosystem for these use cases was immature but that just made it a challenge, which I loved. Use the right tool for the job, you may say. Nah\u2026 I want to use Dart. I thought I was alone in this quest but, I was okay being the crazy one. And then, to my surprise, our customers began asking \u201cWhen can I write my Lambdas in Dart?\u201d \u201cWhen is AWS going to release an SDK for Dart so I can use it in my backends?\u201d It dawned on me that there was perhaps something deeper we were all experiencing, something more fundamental about coding being expressed. JavaScript is one of the most popular server-side languages in use today. A reasonable person with no knowledge of JavaScript may conclude from this that it\u2019s because JavaScript is performant, efficient, or otherwise designed for the server. The reality, though, is that developers will often seek the path of least resistance in an environment replete with friction. It\u2019s easy to deride a choice in language, but it\u2019s hard to downplay the numbers. Software engineers are human, after all\u2014and humans are constantly optimizing their flows. Flutter was born from a desire to solve this age-old quest of optimization\u2014first, as a way to build iOS and Android apps from the same codebase, saving teams the burden of managing two separate products. Then, to desktop and web applications, dramatically reducing the barrier to entry for these platforms too. The vision is largely realized. And, thanks to Dart, it\u2019s been done without sacrificing performance. Our mission with Celest is to fill in the last piece of this puzzle\u2014the cloud. We do that, simply, by starting and ending with Dart. Here\u2019s how you define a cloud function with Celest. And here\u2019s how you add authentication. To test it out, you run celest start and iterate on your backend locally as you build your Flutter app. Your functions hot reload as you save your changes, and integration comes free with an auto-generated client library. And when you\u2019re ready to turn this into a fully managed and auto-scaled backend, you run celest deploy. That\u2019s it. As a Flutter developer, I\u2019ve never left the Dart programming language, never thought about the many layers of abstraction beneath, and didn\u2019t even need to leave my IDE to solve an otherwise laborious and flow-breaking task. I\u2019m back to writing my app in less than 5 minutes. It feels like I\u2019d never left. Celest is the product I always wanted as a Flutter developer, the tool I had felt crazy for wanting at one point. It feels a little less crazy now, but only time will tell :-) You can try and play with Celest for free today. Our cloud offering has started rolling out to the waitlist and will be publicly available in the coming weeks.

We\u2019ve all had painful experiences getting the right insurance for our previous companies and were shocked to learn that there is no easy way to get the coverage you need. Business insurance sucks. It hasn\u2019t changed much since it was first invented in 1750 BC, aside from the fact that there is more and more paperwork and more and more legalese that no one understands. Your options are to either get generic, 50-100 page policies that don\u2019t cover anything you really need or spend hours digging up paperwork and financial statements and answering seemingly irrelevant questions. Large companies get customized policies that cover all their actual risks, but smaller companies all end up with generic policies because it\u2019s too expensive for insurance companies to make custom policies for small/mid-sized businesses and startups. Because of this, a fintech startup will get more or less the same general liability policy as a roofing company. But with AI, the price of intelligence has gone down to nearly 0. This means that we can help customers seamlessly buy and manage policies customized for them - something that was impossible until a year ago. Our mission is to leverage AI to transform every aspect of insurance, from operations to pricing, making it more efficient, personalized, and user-friendly. To do this, we will become the insurance carrier, verticalizing all aspects of the business. Insurance is inherently a words-based industry, and AI has become remarkably proficient in processing and understanding language.

They also struggle to deal effectively with banks or investors to secure growth financing.

Our AI Assistant ensures that any SMB can score its financial health and calculate the financial simulation, even with limited financial knowledge.

It helps everyone in an organization write interactive documents to explain millions of lines of code in minutes instead of months. WHO: We partner with chip manufacturing, enterprise IT, and software product development teams. WHY: Traditionally, these teams spend millions and wait months (sometimes years) to understand their complex technology infrastructure well enough to build on top of it. THE DRIVER DIFFERENCE: Instead, Driver AI is a tool that explains complex codebases in minutes vs. months. This enables teams to rapidly accelerate the technical discovery process and save significant resources. HOW IT WORKS: Driver AI works by digesting a codebase, organizing it for analysis, and harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate interactive explanations for executives, product and technology leaders, and developers. \"Driver AI is a paradigm shift for managing our complex software delivery pipeline.\" - Executive Vice President, Global Semiconductor Company",

        "setting": "The gist: Driver AI is a tool that explains millions of lines of code in minutes instead of months. When you need to do technical discovery, you can use Driver AI\u2019s interactive documentation to understand complex codebases at a fraction of the time and cost. The Problem We Got Sick Of Hi everyone, we\u2019re Adam and Daniel. We\u2019ve spent our careers navigating complex codebases that had little to no documentation and, when it did, often written by engineers no longer with the company. Technical discovery has not only been maddening for us as engineers but also expensive and time-consuming for the business. It costs teams roughly $500,000 and three months of discovery to unpack one codebase. Multiply that by the number of applications in an organization and you're looking at years of discovery and millions of dollars. Companies can\u2019t invest that much into fully comprehending their existing technology stack, so they either abandon critical projects or the technical debt just keeps piling up. How We\u2019re Fixing It Driver AI is a tool that uses LLMs to help teams quickly understand their business-critical systems. We use a simple three-step process: Comprehend: We ingest your existing codebases, organize them within our platform, and generate internal documentation at various levels of abstraction with LLMs. Our platform comprehends code regardless of language, age, or framework. Explain: Next, we provide interactive documentation that explains the capabilities of your codebases and how those capabilities are delivered. This documentation is written at the executive, business, and technical levels so anyone in the organization can understand it. Accelerate Delivery: Now that we\u2019ve slashed the technical discovery process from months to days, you can deliver projects more quickly. Fueled by the context we provide, you can also make better-informed decisions about what to do next, including giving these explanations to LLMs and asking them to do things for you.",

        "setting": "About us Hello \ud83d\udc4b We\u2019re Evita and Rachel, co-founders of Eris Biotech. We met working at the same lab at BYU when Evita was a Ph.D. student and Rachel was an undergrad. We collaborated on a peer-reviewed paper and conference presentations and we\u2019ve been friends since! Rachel went on to Dartmouth for her Ph.D. and later worked at a startup developing cell therapies. Evita went on for a postdoc and a career in drug development in big pharma. Our Backstory Evita had noticed that a lot of good drugs couldn't make it past lead optimization due to toxicity concerns. The drugs were effective, just not safe. Rachel, working on cell therapies, noticed the same thing, some therapies were efficacious but systemic toxicity was a stumbling block. That's when we started to explore strategies to make therapeutics safer and reduce systemic toxicity, and Eris Biotech was born. The Problem Cancer therapies are terrible! It\u2019s a race between who kills you first: the therapeutic or the cancer. At Eris Biotech, we want to help with that, starting with mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that grows on the pleura, the thin layer surrounding the lungs, with a 5-year survival rate of <13%. Current mesothelioma treatments not only fall short in effectiveness but are also systemically toxic, and most patients diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within 14 months after diagnosis. Our Solution Eris Biotech develops drugs that only activate under low oxygen (hypoxic) environments. These drugs are referred to as hypoxia-activated prodrugs or HAPs. A low oxygen or hypoxic environment is a hallmark of the majority of solid tumors, including mesothelioma, and healthy tissues are usually not hypoxic. By delivering active drugs only to the tumor site, we can use more potent drugs without systemic toxicity in cancer therapeutics. To develop our first HAP, we used AI drug discovery tools and AI-designed compounds from a library of over 2.6 million compounds. Our first HAP in development blocks the communication between the tumor and its surroundings. This lack of communication isolates tumors from essential resources, and engages the immune system to aggressively fight tumors.

Mention us: If you like what you see, mention us in Slack groups/social where sales leaders, SDRs, or startup founders hang out. Wait, but why Our journey began with a tale as old as time: we were struggling to sell enterprise contracts for our AI voice product. Even finding companies who perfectly fit our Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) required hours of manual work to research each company to see if the size, product, and team were a good fit for us. THEN we had to get a meeting. We even stopped building so that we could \u201cfocus on GTM\u201d \u2620\ufe0f. None of the sales tools we tried solved this for us. This experience led us to develop Flyflow. Our vision is to make high-quality lead sourcing accessible to everyone, without feeling like you need to learn a new set of tools. The Team Carl and Pritee love building products that make really annoying tasks go away. Most recently, Pritee was Head of Product at Lithic (launch credit/debit cards insanely fast), and before that was on the product team at Plaid (link your bank account to any app in seconds, not days).

We\u2019re Ethan and Isaac, and we\u2019re building Forge. Our journey started as roommates at Stanford where we worked on ad-branded contraceptives, AI-generated Spotify playlists, and exploring new restaurants. We dropped out and are now on a mission to enhance customer relationships and build loyalty for restaurants. The Problem In high school (post-pandemic), we saw firsthand while working at a Korean corndog shop and a mom-and-pop Chinese restaurant that local restaurants struggled with building a presence. Since then, we\u2019ve learned that local businesses and mom-and-pop restaurants face issues with driving repeat, in-person traffic - while losing 30% to third-party delivery apps. Stores needed an easy, user-friendly platform that could: without having to manage an entire app by themselves. We wanted to create a network that allowed users to easily access multiple restaurants from a single app rather than downloading dozens of individual, white-labeled apps. Our Solution: Forge, the last loyalty app you\u2019ll need. Forge is a centralized platform to access loyalty programs for many restaurants and stores. We want to drive in-person traffic and have rolled out new features that encourage engagement and discovery like order-ahead (at select restaurants), a social points leaderboard, and a marketplace to connect food creators. Our vision: We see a future where restaurants form deep ties with local neighborhoods and beyond \u2014 Forge will power this communal growth. Using Forge is easy: 1) Download our app, 2) Check in at stores and earn points, 3) Redeem unique rewards at any store.

At Stoke, Emir was part of a small team that became the fastest to ever go from seed funding to engine hot fire. \ud83e\udde9 The problem: Getting parts into engineers\u2019 hands sets the pace for hardware companies. However, procurement teams use email, spreadsheets, and phone calls to manage billions of dollars of spend. This causes huge coordination issues as many engineers don\u2019t know whose approval they might need, when parts are coming in, and who ordered what. We saw it over and over again at companies of all sizes: poor supply chain operations cause constant delays and bottleneck the pace of development. In 2023, engineers were estimated to spend over 6 hours per week on procurement activities. \ud83d\udca1 Our solution: Our software allows you to request quotes from your suppliers, where you can attach drawings and CAD. We then organize the quotes into a format that\u2019s perfect for comparing your options. Once a supplier has been selected, you can continue to work with them by messaging, sharing files, and getting feedback directly on Forge. All these actions are viewable by your teammates, ensuring everyone is on the same page without the need for time-consuming meetings or searching through documentation. Many companies struggle with unclear procurement operations. Forge offers a highly customizable tool for companies to publicly set their procurement flows in an easily readable manner. No more wondering who\u2019s approval you need or what you\u2019re waiting on. Even better - no IT team is needed for set up and changes can be made at any time!

Clarification - Respond to the missing information asked by AI 3. Result - Get the generated quote along with the execution video We are building these AI Teammates to mimic human-to-human interaction. Our initial customers are saving over $400K in annual costs across these workflows while making them 10X faster and less prone to human errors. We are starting with the workflows of quote generation and renewals as they directly impact the top line of our customers.",

In the years that followed, I completed 1500+ hours of training, got certified as an EMT, and started working as a paid firefighter at neighboring departments. When my department bought new equipment or a new truck, we would turn to Facebook groups and word of mouth to sell our used equipment to other departments in need. For perspective, a new fire truck costs $1.5 to $2.5 million, with used trucks ranging in cost from $50,000 to $1 million.

I joined 23andMe after Series A and helped take it public after over 15 years as VP / Chief Architect. The technology that my team and I developed at 23andMe has delivered more genetic risk reports to more patients than any other in the world, but the translation to patient outcomes remains unsolved. At Haplotype Labs, we are working to close that gap and accelerate the translation of polygenic risk scores into improved healthspan for patients. We\u2019re building the tech I wish I\u2019d had at 23andMe and making it broadly available to the clinic. Precision Preventative Care Preventative care programs currently stratify patients into risk categories for various conditions based on imperfect but still useful risk factors like demographics and family history. Patient stratification allows a care provider to optimize the financial expense and negative side effects of any given prevention program. For example, people with a family history of colon cancer are typically screened more frequently. Driven by falling prices of sequencing and improved model power, preventative care is on the cusp of broadly adopting genetic risk models as a means to further personalize these prevention programs and extend healthspan. These models can also play a role in the discovery of new medicines, and can accelerate clinical trials. Published methods are improving rapidly and new models are published consistently. However, it is difficult to correctly and reliably compare the performance of these models or deploy them at scale.

Hatchet is an open-source, managed task queue focused on scale, reliability, and improved developer experience. https://youtu.be/3myPYVyaqwM The problem Building a reliable application is difficult \u2014 network connections can fail or be interrupted, the application could run out of memory, or a bad commit on production can take down your entire service. To reduce the pressure on APIs, task queues are typically used to offload different parts of the application logic to other services in the system. However, these queues introduce more points of failure \u2014 they require new infrastructure, a new set of integrations to monitor and debug your tasks, and are difficult to use in development. As applications begin to scale, application developers are forced to implement solutions to avoid queue overflow and overcrowding and to think about how to optimize their queues. With LLM APIs \u2014 which are high latency and highly variable in response quality \u2014 these problems are even worse. It\u2019s now typical to ingest, sync, vectorize, and index the entirety of multiple data sources on account creation, and as LLM systems get more agentic, developers need to chain together unreliable LLM calls to fulfill requests. These requests are often slow and without the right architecture delivering a responsive and reliable user experience is challenging. The solution Hatchet is an end-to-end platform for task orchestration. It includes a web UI for monitoring tasks, an API for interacting with tasks and workflows, and SDKs for Python, Typescript, and Golang.

Alexander started working on this after years of wrangling task queues and distributed systems at both Porter and Oneleet, where he experienced the issues of building complex task orchestration and workflows. Gabe came at this from another perspective, having spent the last few years working with ML and more recently LLM stacks, where he saw the architectural problems that many of these applications have.

Hey everyone! I\u2019m Priyang and I\u2019m building Healia. We\u2019ve launched 14 customers in 11 states with $206k in ARR and counting. \ud83d\ude31 The problem: Dual-income health insurance is a lose-lose for companies and families There are 41 million dual-income families in the country and they all have the same problem: whether they choose their plan or their spouse\u2019s, they still have thousands in premium contributions and out-of-pocket costs. Companies face a similar challenge: either employees enroll in their insurance and incur exorbitant costs ($17k/year/family) or the employee misses out on the largest employee benefit available, hurting the company\u2019s recruitment and retention efforts. \u2728 The solution: Both companies \u201csplit\u201d coverage Our product lets employers pay for the out-of-pocket costs (and premiums) of any employee who enrolls in their spouse's plan. There is no need for complicated coordination between employers. Employees just opt out of our customer\u2019s plans and join their spouse\u2019s. We then reimburse any eligible expenses on the spouse\u2019s plan. This saves our customers $10k per enrollee and boosts recruitment and retention with an awesome perk. \ud83d\udca1 How it works (in three easy steps) \ud83d\udcbb Our technology is so powerful that we even sell it separately We created a tool for employees that lets them compare costs between their employer's plan and their spouse's. Employees can upload a PDF of their spouse\u2019s benefits guide, and our LLM will process the data, allowing families to see all of their options modeled out (see image below). This feature has been so popular that companies like GoFundMe, Stew Leonard\u2019s, and Sectigo use our technology just to educate employees on what plan to choose. \ud83d\ude80 14 customers launched across 11 states with $206k in ARR Initially, we thought only white-collar companies would be interested, but half of our customers have been in traditional industries like manufacturing, food and beverage, and retail. We're helping businesses across all geographies and industries lower costs and make healthcare more affordable. \ud83d\udc4b Ask: Connect us with:",

In the face of these issues, they also continue to miss out on thousands of dollars in high-margin revenue due missed appointments and poor scheduling practices, as many rely on manual and inefficient workflows for patient scheduling. What makes it even trickier is that patient behavior is unpredictable, with patients regularly canceling their appointments and going inactive, creating additional strain on the front desk. Solution Hemingway is an AI patient scheduler for dental practices. Through one-click, practices integrate our software with their existing EHR. Our AI agent books unscheduled patients, handles inbound requests for appointments, and automatically reschedules cancellations as they occur. We enable booking through phone, text, and web-based chat. Our software books a patient a day on average for customers, leading to thousands in net new revenue per week.

For example, Henry can create a full deal package for a broker selling an office building in Dogpatch in minutes instead of weeks. This will ensure that brokers maximize their time in the most value-added part of their business: relationships and sales. Traditional brokers often spend as much as 50% of their time on tasks that do not contribute to their bottom line. From basic financial analysis to marketing presentations to win future business to basic operational support, brokers often struggle with the manual and time-consuming realities of their business. These tasks are an incredibly painful bottleneck for brokers, which interferes with their primary goal of building relationships to buy and sell property. We are creating Henry to solve this problem. Henry is an AI copilot that takes all of the messy, unstructured data that defines CRE transactions and consolidates it into clean marketing deliverables & financial analyses in minutes rather than weeks. Long term, we plan on automating the entire deal flow process for brokers to make their cycle time for a deal an order of magnitude faster. You can find an example of what we do below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZm40bj5mL0 I (Sammy) led Lev for the last five years, a 200+ person series B real estate financing marketplace that I co-founded.

As carriers struggle to hire, existing talent is getting overloaded and under-trained, causing severe retention issues at most large carriers.

As a result, average claim costs are rising, squeezing carriers expense ratios at the same time as inflation causes ballooning medical costs.

        "problem": "Business banking is difficult. More so if you are global. Cross-border payments pose several challenges due to the complexities involved in transferring funds across different countries and jurisdictions. Global payments are expensive One of the more basic issues with FX transactions is the lack of transparency in terms of the cost to execute FX payments. These costs can include wire transfer fees, correspondent bank fees, currency conversion fees, and intermediary fees, among others. While existing market providers might stress that one factor is low (lower than that of a competitor), that same institution might have high fees in another area, offsetting those savings. In general for every dollar a business moves from the US to India, business loses 7%. Global payments are slow In the majority of instances, international bank transfers are facilitated via the SWIFT network. This network ensures the transmission of your payment to its intended recipient. Nevertheless, the path isn't always direct. Certain payments may be routed through intermediaries, often referred to as correspondent banks, akin to making multiple connecting flights before reaching your final destination. Generally speaking, international bank transfers will arrive within one to five working days. There\u2019s a compliance risk Each transaction must be promptly reported to the Central Bank of India, accompanied by the correct invoice and purpose codes (of which there are numerous variations), sign-off from chartered accountants, etc. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in payment delays extending for months. And There\u2019s a FX risk The conversion rates between USD and INR are variable. What you receive today may differ from what you get in five days.

We\u2019re building this on top of PyBaMM, the world\u2019s leading open-source battery modeling software, which was created by our team and is now used by most battery engineering teams around the world. Our ask: If you are a battery engineer or know one, reach out to info@ionworks.com for a demo Meet the team We (Valentin, Rob, Tom) have PhDs in Maths/Chemical Engineering from Oxford/East Anglia/Leeds & UCL, and a collective 20 years of experience working on physics-based battery simulations. As academics, we were frustrated by the scientific reproducibility crisis, so we created an open-source project to share our research and hold ourselves accountable. This turned out to be something people wanted, and PyBaMM has now grown to become the leading open-source battery simulation package used by engineers in battery companies and academic labs around the world. We\u2019re now building Ionworks to scale up this success and bring the power of digital design to every single battery engineer. The Need Batteries are a crucial technology underpinning the electrification of every application ranging from EVs to grid storage. This makes the battery market worth $150b today (1.5% of global GDP), with projected growth to $680b in 10 years (4% of projected global GDP). However, batteries still need to improve massively to meet a difficult set of demands: higher energy and power density, faster charge times, lower cost, longer lifetimes, and better safety. Why designing better batteries is difficult Batteries come in all shapes and sizes, with complex and nonlinear effects of design inputs on performance outputs. As a result, battery engineering teams build and test thousands of physical prototypes to find the optimal design for their application. This is an expensive and time-consuming process (up to $1000 and 2 years for each individual test), which leads to $100m/5 year battery development cycles. This makes batteries the bottleneck in many product development cycles, such as new laptops and electric cars. The Solution We\u2019re doing for batteries what CFD (computational fluid dynamics) did for aerodynamics and CAD (computer-aided design) did for structural and electrical engineering: move the design problem into the digital world. Generic engineering software already exists but requires specialist knowledge and decades of experience to build battery-specific models. We\u2019re building software that makes this process available to any battery engineer. Our solution is built for the cloud, providing the interfaces and cost models to do this at scale. How it works We move battery design into the digital world using the following process: The underlying physics-based models are old-school partial differential equations that describe the chemical reactions, lithium transport, and heat exchange happening inside a battery. These models generalize well from their training data, which allows us to build accurate models from small amounts of data. Our secret sauce is that we\u2019ve built software that makes steps 2 and 3 fast and robust. Ask",

However, although there is evidence that the same scaling laws likely apply to robotics as well, the field is stymied by lack of access to the same large, in-the-wild datasets that work well in other domains, resulting in foundation models with poor cross-embodiment and out-of-distribution generalization.

Hi, we\u2019re Claire and Ralph, the team behind Maia. Our mission is to empower couples to build stronger, more fulfilling relationships. With Maia, we're making personalized relationship coaching accessible to everyone, at any time. \ud83e\udd14 The Problem Despite the pivotal role relationships play in our happiness and overall well-being, existing support systems fall short. Traditional couples therapy is still inaccessible and stigmatized, couples are increasingly turning online for advice, and couple apps provide static content that lacks personalization. On average, it takes a couple 6 years of being unhappy before seeking help. We're to navigate the complexities of building lasting relationships largely on our own, using trial and error and the hope that love will find a way (divorce rates are >50%). \ud83d\udca1 Our Solution Maia reimagines relationship care by blending AI coaching, expert guidance, and informal chat interactions into a seamless, engaging experience for couples. Building a lasting relationship is about more than just maintenance; it\u2019s also about turning your relationship into a rewarding adventure. With Maia, personal growth and wellness become accessible and enjoyable for every couple. Whether it's planning the perfect date night, resolving a conflict, or learning more about one another, Maia offers a roadmap to a happier, healthier relationship. Here\u2019s what Dr. Marisa T. Cohen, PhD, LMFT, our relationship expert, says about Maia: Maia is a powerful tool that provides psychoeducation about relationships, normalizes the experiences we have and challenges we face, as well as prompts users to reflect on their lived experiences, values, and goals, thereby encouraging a greater level of self-awareness. The best part is that engaging with Maia feels like chatting with a friend, one that not only has deep understanding of the human connection, but also a lot of sass. I am proud to work with the Maia team in training Maia to approach users from a place of curiosity like a clinician, present tips and valuable resources like a relationship expert, and engage with users from a place of deep appreciation of the human bond. Here\u2019s what our user K. said about Maia: I am beyond grateful I came across it. I\u2019ve been recommending it to friends along the way as it\u2019s helped immensely as a support outlet but also grow my thoughts when I fall narrow minded from an emotional state. I\u2019ve personally found it to be far better than messaging-therapist platforms because of the lack of opinions and bias. I think that\u2019s probably a major difference that pushes me to truly absorb the advice Maia gives. \ud83d\udcd6 Our Story For us, Maia\u2019s mission is deeply personal. Having both grown up in first-generation divorced households and navigated the ups and downs of our own relationships, we recognized the universal need for a proactive approach to relationship health. By combining our expertise in AI and psychology, we built Maia to address this need. \ud83d\ude4c Our Ask",

Hallucinations can quickly deteriorate the user experience and are difficult or impossible to fully fix. Model outages or degraded performance make any meaningful traffic a nightmare. Consistent response times are usually only solved today with dedicated compute environments, which can be too costly for most companies to consider. The more you make progress on these issues, the more you become locked into a provider.",
        "solution": "Maitai integrates seamlessly between the application and model providers to handle the heavy lifting behind the scenes. The result? Higher quality, reliable model output with passive incremental improvement - without any new code. We leverage our robust real-time evaluation engine to build a deep understanding of the customer's application, as well as the capabilities of all major models, in order to deliver consistent, dependable results. This abstraction layer is essential as the AI landscape evolves and new models emerge. Real-time Evaluations For each application, we build an understanding of the expectations that the user has for each request. We then evaluate all model output to ensure it adheres to these expectations, in under 200ms. Detected faults can be surfaced to the user in a callback or webhook. Users can also allow Maitai to leverage these evals to autocorrect any faulty output we find, ensuring clean, reliable responses. Example: One of our customers is a voice-ordering company for restaurants. They use Maitai to ensure the model always requests consent from the customer before sending a text message. Failure to do so would put them out of compliance with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, resulting in heavy fines and lawsuits. Maitai has prevented this from happening 14 times. Highly-available Inference As AI adoption grows, all providers are having trouble keeping up with the demand. As we continuously profile all models we support, we see this manifest as outages and degraded performance many times throughout each day. Maitai uses our model health data to preemptively fall back to a similar model if we notice degraded performance or an outage. Avoid failed responses and get more consistent response times without shelling out hundreds of thousands of dollars on dedicated compute. Our health checks on gpt-4o from us-west2 show consistent performance only ~90% of the time, with frequent spikes to 400%+ usual response times. Passive Incremental Improvement With Maitai, you gain access to models that are higher quality than GPT-4o, 5x faster, and 10x cheaper \u2014 tailored specifically for your application. Our evaluation data not only allows us to immediately improve output quality and reliability, but also lends way to passively building application-specific models that are higher quality, more performant, and cost less than closed-source alternatives. Access the best models for your application, with updates as often as every few days. Actionable Alerts Get briefed on problems as they occur to quickly remedy a bad situation. Maitai surfaces real-time faults or session summaries right in Slack, then allows you to chat with your data to explore deeper.

We were early engineers at Convoy (#12 and #50) and where there until the company was acquired by Flexport last Fall. Our broad and recent experience at Convoy has given us deep insights into the complexities of the freight industry. Manifold Freight is our response to simplifying a piece of the $800 billion freight industry. Our first target market is Asset Based Carriers - a radically underserved segment.. The Underserved Large Asset-Based Carriers \ud83d\ude9b Over the last decade, there has been a surge of tech investment into the freight industry (e.g., Convoy, Uber Freight) - but their focus has been maximizing the margin and capacity of smaller carriers (< 10 trucks). Medium to large Asset-Based Carriers, especially those operating with 50+ trucks, have seen minimal interest from tech despite representing more than ~60% of the U.S. truckload capacity - roughly 2,600,000 trucks! (data) Nowhere is this more apparent than in the $100 billion spot freight market. Existing solutions don\u2019t work well for medium and large Carriers. The spot freight market is fragmented across hundreds of load boards, thousands of brokers, and millions of shippers. For medium and large carriers, this fragmentation creates a logistical nightmare. Finding a single spot freight shipment requires a dispatcher to manually login, filter and compare each load against their fleet and availability. Sorting through thousands of emails, multiple load boards and making many time consuming phone calls. The result? Dispatchers go the path of least resistance - large public load boards. They can\u2019t take advantage of the much higher value, shipper direct freight because it\u2019s physically impossible to sort through them all every day. These public load boards take an 18-30% cut of the shipment price that otherwise could have gone to the carrier. For the average medium-sized carrier doing 50 spot loads a week, this represents almost $500,000 in lost yearly revenue (2,600 shipments x $700 \u00d7 24% = $462,280). The Manifold Solution Manifold solves this problem by aggregating all available spot freight opportunities, including shipper direct spot freight, into one single dashboard. Finding and bidding on quality shipper direct freight is easier with Manifold than finding low quality loads on DAT, the current industry standard.

This ensures that decision-makers, regardless of whether they were on the original call, have access to the most relevant information in one centralized location.

After the call, they would need to convey this information to other decision-makers on their team who weren't on the call. However, they often struggled to communicate the value propositions as effectively as the sales rep. This miscommunication frequently led to delays or even halted deals, costing sellers anywhere from $10k to $500k+ per deal. This led the founders to create Mica. Sales reps needed a way to present the highlights of the call so that everyone in the prospect's organization could get the same experience of being on the original call, without having to sit through the entire conversation.

Every developer knows this experience: we insert console.log everywhere and catch some promising leads, but nothing happens before \"time runs out.\" Eventually, the slow/buggy code never gets fixed, problems pile up on a backlog, and our end users are hurt. We started Million to fix this. A VSCode extension that identifies slow code and suggests fixes (like Grammarly, for performance!) The website is here: https://million.dev/blog/lint I realized this was a problem when I tried to write an optimizing compiler for React in high school (src: https://github.com/aidenybai/million). It garnered a lot of interest (14K+ stars) and usage, but it didn't solve all user problems. Traditionally, devtools either hinge on full static analysis OR runtime profiling. We found success in a mixture of the two with dynamic analysis. During compilation, we inject instrumentation where it's necessary. From there, the runtime collects this info and feeds it back into VSCode. This is a great experience! Instead of switching around windows and trying to interpret flamegraphs, you can just see it inline with your code. We are still in the very early days of experimentation! Million Lints focuses on solving unnecessary re-renders right now and will move on to handling slow-downs arising from the React ecosystem: state managers, animations, bundle sizes, waterfalls, etc. Our eventual goal is to create a toolchain that keeps your whole web infrastructure fast, automatically - frontend to backend. In the next few weeks, we're planning to open source (MIT) the Million Lint compiler and the VSCode extension. To earn a living, we will charge a subscription model for customized linting. We believe this aligns our incentives with yours: we only make money when we make your app faster. We'd love to know your thoughts \u2013 happy to answer :)",

With the explosive growth of deep learning, there are over 1 million ML researchers who do computationally intensive experiments every day. They use Jupyter notebooks to do so, but every time they want to try out a new idea, they need to get the notebooks running on cloud machines. This process, repeated hundreds of times a month, is time-consuming and error-prone. Moonglow reliably brings the time-to-experiment down from 5 minutes to 20 seconds. Just as Vercel and Replit abstracted away the lower levels of the computing stack for web developers and programmers, we do the same for ML researchers. https://moonglow.ai",

Join our waitlist for early access. \u274c THE PROBLEM When traveling abroad, do you find yourself asking if merchants accept card? How much cash do you need? Where can you get the best rate? Payments around the world are very fragmented and rely heavily on cash, or an alternative like QR code digital wallets. And for foreigners traveling, this typically means you need some combination of card and cash. In many countries, merchants may not accept card payments, and when they do, they often charge extra fees. Cash payments can also be costly due to high foreign exchange and ATM fees. \u2705 THE SOLUTION Moreta simplifies payments for international travelers, letting you pay like a local using just your phone. Users download Moreta, upload documentation verifying their identity, connect their bank account to load funds, and pay, all within minutes.

Today the suite includes apps like: \u2022 Go links: Go links allows anyone in the org to easily name any link so team members can jump directly to the information that matters most: go/sales, go/production, go/anything-you-want. \u2022 Profiles with Personality: OrgOrg profiles are as insightful as they are delightful. They not only show you the expected org chart data, but also highlight accomplishments, how you like to work, and who you are as a person. \u2022 Goal tracking: Track, share, and collaborate on \"big rock\" goals on the cadence that makes sense for your team from daily to annually. \u2022 Branded New Tab: Keep the team focused the next major milestone, broadcast announcements, and keep important links top of mind every time a new browser tab is opened. \u2022 All Hands Q&A: Crowdsource questions, anonymously if desired, for large team meetings to make sure everyone's voice is heard, and the most top of mind questions are answered and recorded. \u2022 Smart Groups: Create rules based groups of people and use them to make sure the right people are in the right conversations and have the right access. For example, anyone with the title of \"Software Engineer\" should be in the #eng slack channel and eng@ google group. \u2022 On-call: Schedule smart rotations that take into account balancing the load and using signals from calendar schedules to make sure you don't waste time figuring out who can cover what in a fair way. Easily page the on-call from slack, API, or OrgOrg directly. \u2022 And more...

The Problem - There are too many SaaS pointwise solutions! Seriously. The world over-rotated to point solutions in SaaS. It\u2019s not unusual to have 20+ minor SaaS products to do various organizational chores. It\u2019s easy to see why this happened because you need different tools at different sizes, but it\u2019s also not what users want. It\u2019s expensive, annoying to manage, and none of them work together to create a better user experience. The Solution - OrgOrg! OrgOrg draws on 25 years of experience leading high-performing teams from founding to big tech. We're building a suite with all the internal SaaS tools that you need for each stage of your company. You save money, time, and they all work together nicely. For early stage companies, Go links, \u201cBig Rock\u201d Goal tracking, and branded New browser tabs (with countdowns to your next milestone \u2014 like Demo Day) are great ways to stay focused and efficient. For larger teams, add in Profiles with personality, Smart Groups (eg, add all engineers to the #eng channel & eng@ group), All Hands Q&A, and smart On-Call management to fight the problems that come with the complexity of larger teams. Our roadmap is full of high utility internal apps and tools that build on each to help you run your company better. No matter the size of your org, you can be confident that the right internal tools will be in place when you need them. Just as no one buys Google Slides alone, buying just an All-Hands Q&A product isn\u2019t enough. OrgOrg\u2019s suite offers significantly more value than the sum of the parts of existing pointwise solutions.

Enterprise software companies are leaving a lot of potential revenue on the table\u2014 some offer a whole menu of products, with each enterprise customer only taking advantage of one or a few of the offerings. The solution: Overstand is designed to read all customer communications and flag opportunities for expansion of customer accounts. It identifies hidden expansion opportunities that are buried in customer communications by analyzing every single message and comparing it to product docs and even existing use cases at other enterprise accounts. The team: We met at Palantir several years ago and both recognized the importance of empowering customer-facing teams to fully understand and sell highly technical and complex products.

This is why sourcing high-quality candidates at the top of the funnel is often the most time-intensive step in the hiring pipeline. Often, a sourcer juggles finding candidates for multiple roles. It\u2019s a tedious job, cycling through pages and pages on LinkedIn and personalizing each candidate's message. We believe an AI Recruiter can find and engage candidates as well as a human sourcer, saving time and money. How it Works Parasale will: Why We\u2019re Building This We were both early engineers at Gem (S17), the market leader in sourcing tools. We\u2019ve seen firsthand how time- and cost-prohibitive sourcing is and how it\u2019s often limited to only the highest priority roles. Yet, it can really scale a stellar team when it\u2019s done well. We believe now is the right time to build an AI Recruiter. We can fully reimagine the recruiting stack from the ground up with AI. Meet the Team Josh was an engineering manager at Gem where he managed the core sourcing team and built talent marketing functionality. He was previously an engineer at Uber and graduated from Stanford with a BS in Computer Science. Jet was the 2nd engineer at Gem where he built and scaled all aspects of the product. He has a particular fondness for building Chrome extensions. He was previously an engineer at ClassDojo and Amazon. He holds a BS and MEng in Computer Science from MIT.",

        "setting": "Summary: ParcelBio is addressing the biggest problem in RNA therapeutics: delivery. We are developing a programmable technology to safely and specifically deliver mRNA to diverse cell types in the body. We will initially use this technology to develop drugs for long-overlooked kidney disorders, chronic liver diseases, and immune system dysregulation\u2014but that\u2019s just the beginning. The Problem: mRNA therapeutics have already saved millions of lives with the advent of the COVID-19 vaccine. We believe they can save millions more. That\u2019s because mRNA is a versatile therapeutic: It can be programmed to produce just about anything the body could need. The key hurdle limiting the full therapeutic potential of mRNA is delivery; it\u2019s hard to get enough mRNA exactly where it needs to go. To safely and efficiently deliver an mRNA therapeutic requires a delivery vehicle that imparts two features: stability and targeting. The current delivery vehicle of choice is a lipid nanoparticle (LNP), which is essentially a fat droplet that encapsulates the mRNA. LNPs work great for vaccines, but applications beyond vaccines require more specific targeting and higher doses than what best-in-class LNP technologies can provide. Our Solution: Our proprietary technology, which we call \u2018STAmP\u2019 (Stabilization and Targeting by Annealing mRNA to ParcelOligos), is a completely new way of delivering an mRNA medicine without a nanoparticle. STAmP\u2019s key innovation is the use of \u2018ParcelOligos\u2019, which was inspired by the clinical success of another type of RNA therapeutic called siRNA that has already moved on from nanoparticle-based delivery. ParcelOligos bind to an mRNA molecule to convert it into a more stable form so that it can survive the journey to desired cell types. In addition to imparting stability, ParcelOligos are attached to interchangeable \u2018keys\u2019 that only unlock cells with the corresponding lock. These keys are based on naturally occurring molecules that the body already uses to recognize specific cell types. We will use STAmP to develop wholly-owned drugs for kidney, liver, and immune system disorders. We will also partner with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to make improved mRNA vaccines and to deliver CRISPR gene-editing tools to diverse cell types. The Team: David holds a PhD from MIT where he studied the function of siRNAs, was a faculty member at UCSF investigating mRNA biology, and most recently was the Vice President of RNA Platform at a leading mRNA therapeutics startup, Orbital Therapeutics. Chris received his PhD from UCSF where he studied RNA protection in viruses. He was hired by David at Orbital Therapeutics, where he went on to author multiple pending patents related to the stabilization of therapeutic RNAs. Our Ask: We would appreciate any introductions to investors or potential drug-development partners\u2014especially those interested in making better vaccines and delivering CRISPR gene-editing tools to diverse cell types.

The obvious solution is to use robots, but 75% of all U.S. manufacturers are effectively unable to use traditional robotic automation due to their high-mix production: they produce a wide array of products in small quantities. Traditional automation is rigid and needs new fixturing and re-programming for each part, and doesn\u2019t provide ROI for high-mix manufacturers since so little of each part is produced. If America is unable to capitalize on the current manufacturing and AI boom, we lose out on $1 trillion per year in opportunity cost and the chance to strengthen our weakened industrial base.

We return in real time faster than LLMs and keep our threat intelligence up to date so you don\u2019t have to. Hey folks! We are excited to launch the first AI Detection and Response (AIDR) system for LLM Applications. For those familiar with traditional security, think of us as EDR for LLM systems. Users of LLM applications want powerful functionality, and need a way to preserve that powerful functionality without exposing themselves to security risks, specifically: Common misconceptions There are some common misconceptions about securing LLM applications. LLM security risks still exist even if: If LLM applications read external data and send it to an LLM, they inherently have security risks and create security risks for their customers. We know this because we\u2019ve pentested over 50 LLM applications in production and found the same vulnerability: reading data that could have originated from an attacker can manipulate LLMs into: LLMs are now the weakest link in the chain, and traditional security risks are being delivered via LLMs straight into your systems and nobody is monitoring it. It is the same risk as arbitrarily executing code or hiring a malicious employee. What is the threat? LLM applications and agents commonly do three things: Attackers can easily hide, within larger input sources, adversarial input intended to mislead LLMs. Here\u2019s an example of an adversarial input hidden in white text, intended to exfiltrate user data files, on a seemingly innocent website: When somebody sends this webpage to an LLM for processing, the injected content overrides your system prompt. If the system prompt is overridden, the LLM is now your adversary and any other data accessible by the LLM can be leaked easily, the LLM can execute phishing attacks within your trusted environment, or it can manipulate systems it has access to. So although a normal workflow and what you expect might look like this: Simply by having an LLM in the loop, you expose yourself to much worse risks: Attacks in the Wild We\u2019ve gone through most of the published adversarial inputs over the past year, and here are the top three threats we saw, ranked by severity. Let\u2019s walk through a few of the most interesting examples. 1) Hacking Google Bard - From Prompt Injection to Data Exfiltration This is an exciting one. The pentesters found that if a user of Bard Chat navigates to any source with an injected instruction - even a YouTube video - the attacker would be able to get the contents of any uploaded file from Google Drive. They did this by getting the chat to render a markdown image, and append the contents of the Google Drive documents to the image. When the image is rendered in markdown, a GET request is sent to the attacker\u2019s server, and they get all the content. That\u2019s scary; imagine a random attacker having access to all of your Google docs just because you chatted with Bard Chat. (source: https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/google-bard-data-exfiltration/) PromptArmor would prevent this immediately - it catches the inputted injection they used. It would also flag some of the exfiltrated information (PII such as name, address, etc) on the output side. 2) Turning Bing Chat Into a Data Pirate (source: https://greshake.github.io/) This one is scary. The attacker successfully injected Bing Chat to turn into an adversarial social engineer, which is actively trying to exfiltrate data. It would sneakily get the user to reveal their name, and then as soon as the user revealed their name, it would suggest that the user clicks on an exfiltration link. The link URL has the contents of their name appended but obfuscated. (source: https://greshake.github.io/) The scary thing is that the user thinks they are safe because they are interacting with Bing Chat, a trusted source, but they are really perpetually at risk. This could be used to scam a user into giving up their credit card information, their date of birth, their address, or other personal information. A scammer could use this information to propagate more threats (more phishing, scam mail, blackmail, etc). Again, PromptArmor catches this injection on input, so it would never be sent to the LLM. It would also flag the output link as malicious and catch the PII before the link is rendered to the user. You can also check out our blog post which has another example of data exfiltration. Why do I need to worry about this now? How does PromptArmor work? There are two ways to make sure LLM agents and applications are secure enough to protect user data and prevent known threats like phishing, malware, etc. Given that the agents most useful to customers are also the most powerful, we find the second approach to be more fruitful. However, usually, after a threat is detected and reported, companies seem to go into panic mode and implement approach 1 in a hurry, which makes their product worse. We have 3 offerings that fall under the second approach: PromptArmor continually monitors for threats across all mechanisms your LLM Agent or Application uses to interact with data sources (external or internal), and LLMs. Threats are always evolving and new ones are emerging every day. PromptArmor stays up to date so you don\u2019t have to. Here is a system diagram, which mirrors the architecture many companies are using. How do I sign up?",

However, such an undertaking is long, costly, and is oftentimes a distraction from their core business. \u2692\ufe0f Solution Reform is the sweet spot between buying a generic off-the-shelf TMS and building one in-house. Our APIs and pre-built components allow logistics service providers to build the modern transportation management system they need - faster, better, and without the maintenance overhead. Our first product is an AI-powered API suite that allows logistics service providers to build custom automations for mundane tasks related to their TMS. Our APIs are used to power automation use cases including: \ud83d\udea2 Shipment and quote creation \ud83d\udc6e Customs clearance filing \ud83c\udfed Warehouse order intake \ud83e\uddfe Invoice reconciliation \u2699\ufe0f How it works Eliminate manual document analysis: Our customizable AI-powered data extraction API, purpose-built for the logistics industry, allows you to extract data with high accuracy from incoming emails and documents including commercial invoices, BOLs, packing lists, and more. Integrate with any TMS: Our Universal API allows you to plug extracted data into any system without the burden of building and maintaining integrations. Build beautiful interfaces: Our headless UI components allow you to embed our APIs directly in your products and customer-facing dashboards.

Companies use Resonance as a one-stop shop for campaign creation, intelligent experimentation/prioritization, analytics, and impression management to boost net revenue retention following user onboarding. Schedule a demo or get in contact. The Team: I used to work as a SWE at Dropbox, DoorDash, and Microsoft. In particular, I helped build a similar platform to Resonance at Dropbox that generated $100 million ARR. I wanted to start Resonance because 1) I felt there were many ways to improve that particular tool and 2) I wanted to bring that tool to other companies that need it but don\u2019t have the bandwidth to build it themselves. The Problem: For companies that depend on product-led growth (primarily consumer/SMB/startup-centric companies), their website remains their most valuable marketing channel. Post-user onboarding, these companies rely on in-product messaging to drive feature adoption so they can retain users. Unfortunately, this sort of strategy only works at scale, and there are many challenges in doing so. Below are some non-trivial functionalities that modern companies require to launch effective campaigns with velocity: Solving this problem is crucial, as millions in ARR is left on the table if companies cannot properly scale their in-product feature discovery/awareness/education. Companies like Dropbox that have built tooling to address the above challenges have generated up to $100 million ARR from the increased user retention. The Solution: Solving this problem requires building a centralized system where any stakeholder (technical or non-technical) can effortlessly launch campaigns to drive in-product feature adoption. Holistic assessment of campaign performance, global impression management, and optimized campaign targeting can only work at scale if there is a single system that serves as a repository for all campaigns and governs campaign creation. Resonance addresses this by providing a central platform where developers and non-developers can both easily launch in-product feature adoption campaigns within minutes, with the above functionalities provided out of the box.

Senso is building an AI-powered knowledge base to expand customer relationships, starting in the Credit Union space.",
        "problem": "We\u2019ve started in the US Credit Union industry. Why Credit Unions? Because expanding member relationships is their highest priority. Currently, inefficient means in accessing information, policies and procedures, and past behavior bring unexpected overhead.

Our product provides a flexible way to centralize enterprise knowledge, such as documents and conversational data, that LLMs utilize to improve information flow across support and marketing teams. Our GTM strategy is to partner with industry leaders to distribute our product. In the Credit Union space, we\u2019ve partnered with CU 2.0 to launch an industry-specific version of Senso called CuCopilot, built using our APIs. Here\u2019s an example of how our growing customer base is using our product to provide more timely and personalized service to members. Ingest and summarize thousands of conversations so that support and marketing teams can understand what members are asking. Examples of metrics surfaced are sentiment and call purpose. In this example, the Credit Union decides to track members speaking about loan and account openings, and sets a frequency to auto-generate weekly FAQ\u2019s based on interactions. Once the FAQ is generated, support agents can better answer questions related to loan and account openings by searching for auto-generated responses. One of our customers, TruStone Financial, has seen a significant uptick in the speed in which they are able to answer questions, and their documentation has improved response quality significantly.",

We are building Shiboleth. If you saw a recent Garry Tan\u2019s tweet about bookface launch live, that was us :). We were chosen as one of the top products based upon \u201cvotes from batch and YC alumni\u201d. Esty previously worked in the intersection of compliance and conversational intelligence. And Bivu has a decade-long experience in NLP and AI. Together, we are excited to innovate in the regulatory compliance sector, an area that is long due for innovation. We believe that automating compliance can enable smaller financial institutions to exist in the long term. \u274c The Problem: Consumer lending is very litigious and consequently, it is heavily regulated: agencies such as CFPB, FDIC, and OCC impose a lot of intentionally ambiguous regulations. Currently, the audits are extremely manual. Even with a large team of auditors, they can only check a fraction of the calls\u2014sometimes as low as 2% which means that violations can be missed. Often, there is \u201cjust enough ambiguity\u201d that the calls and communication warrant manual reviews. This is problematic because an internal audit system might not suffice for compliance purposes. \ud83e\udd14 How does it work?: Shiboleth automatically flags compliance violations in customer interactions. It does this by syncing with the companies' runbooks, using advanced LLMs and NLP to parse relevant regulations. Our extensive database of public reviews, CFPB complaints, and enforcement actions helps us identify the most enforceable regulations and recommend appropriate mitigation actions.

Our customers save dozens of hours a week spent on repetitive manual tasks. \ud83d\udc6c Team We met five years ago while studying at the CDTM in Munich. Most recently, Berni worked as a full-stack engineer at Tesla on the Autopilot team, whilst Raban finished his engineering master\u2019s at Stanford. At Tesla, Berni built tons of internal tooling and saw the supply chain inefficiencies firsthand. During the batch, Raban worked as a purchasing manager for one of our customers. \ud83c\udf0b Problem Supply chain data is spread across multiple platforms, such as ERPs, custom spreadsheets, and email inboxes, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of visibility. Supply Chain Managers spend hours each week searching through emails and spreadsheets to track the status of parts procurement, from request to quote to award. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors and delays. For example, changes in production schedules require Supply Chain Managers to follow up with all suppliers individually to adjust their purchase orders. Quotes that aren\u2019t used are lost in the abyss of email inboxes. Suppliers are reluctant to upload quotes to yet another portal and often fail to notify about delays, leading to costly production standstills. \ud83d\ude9b Solution Soff connects suppliers, parts, and quotes into a single platform. We integrate with ERPs and email to automate supplier communication, send RFQs, and issue purchase orders. We turn unstructured email and PDFs into SQL-ready data, injecting quotes directly into the ERP system. We eliminate the need for manual data entry and dedicated supplier portals, thus increasing supplier response rates. Our platform stores quote data, ensuring no loss of information when switching suppliers or moving from single-source to dual-source. It also tracks parts from the initial request through to the final receipt, providing a complete overview for supplier management. Soff enables manufacturers to deliver higher-quality products faster.

They practice on our AI simulations before seeing real patients. The problem: Medical education can't scale with outdated methods to meet the growing doctor demand. There\u2019s a serious doctor shortage, and governments are responding by mandating increases in medical school seats. Schools are still relying on outdated, unscalable approaches like using actors to simulate patients one by one. Medical schools need solutions that can expand with this demand without losing quality\u2014to fix this, we\u2019re helping medical schools and hospitals scale clinical training with AI. The Solution: Scalable clinical training with AI Soma Lab scales clinical training with AI simulations that let students practice patient interactions, moving beyond the outdated methods. Our platform provides realistic, on-demand practice that adapts to the needs of medical schools, allowing them to train more students effectively without sacrificing quality. We\u2019re solving the bottleneck in clinical education, making it scalable, flexible, and fit for the future. The Team We met at the University of Chicago after joining the same fraternity. Vrishank failed a clinical communications test and couldn\u2019t afford the $9,000 tutor fee. So instead, we built an AI clinical communications coach. Vrishank's score went up to the top quartile, so we said screw it and launched the tool. In 3 weeks, we hit $5k MRR and 2.5k users. Seeing the impact this would have if applied to all of healthcare, we decided to build the AI infrastructure for medical education. While in high school, Vrishank created a healthcare education app, which scaled to 120,000+ downloads in 6 months. Tigran was the lead machine learning researcher in a bioinformatics lab at the Luddy School of Informatics.

In-situ weather observation has the most impact on weather models, but it\u2019s incredibly expensive to collect. The US National Weather Service spends over a billion dollars annually just on its network of weather balloons, stations, and aircraft sensors.

        "problem": "Hundreds of terabytes of weather data are collected from satellites, ground stations, airplanes and weather balloons every day. A typical weather satellite costs more than $100 million to launch, and the US National Weather Service spends over a billion dollars a year just on its sparse network of weather balloon stations. A small handful of organizations then pipe that data into billion-dollar supercomputers to run the world\u2019s most expensive physics simulations four times a day. Despite this cost, there are still places in the US where we don't know what the temperature is going to be two days from now. And for the rest of the world that lacks adequate weather infrastructure? There\u2019s always the weather rock. AI models are upending the expensive physics simulations. These models are more accurate, running at higher resolutions for a fraction of the cost. But, like most AIs, weather models are hungry for data, and the reality is that most of the world isn\u2019t covered despite the costly infrastructure.This is because direct observation (as opposed to satellite observation) is both incredibly impactful but also incredibly expensive. This cost leaves most of the Earth without in-situ observations. Oceans have especially poor coverage, and no matter how good your model is, you still need to know what\u2019s happening over the Pacific today to predict the weather in SF tomorrow. Sorcerer is deploying a global network of low-cost, persistent weather drones to provide real-time data in previously unreachable locations. Our system collects 30x more observations than the entire global observation infrastructure at 1% the cost. We use this data to train a weather model that\u2019s already competitive with best-in-class traditional weather prediction, while being 10,000x cheaper.",

Kirk :) _ _ Hi, everyone. We are Ashi Dissanayake and Reza Fetanat, the team behind Spaceium. Here's a brief introduction: Ashi is an Aerospace Engineer specializing in Orbital Mechanics and rocket propulsion. Ashi has worked on real-time simulation models for uncrewed return missions to asteroids and on NASA-related aerodynamics projects. Reza is also a space enthusiast and a Mechanical Engineer specializing in Robotics, structures, and Cryogenics.

In our spare time, we enjoyed working together to build rockets in the backyard, sometimes leading to interesting experiences with backyard fires. \ud83d\udd25 Throughout our careers, we've noticed the constraints on space missions due to the lack of ability to refuel or repair spacecraft in orbit. The current solutions are costly, and a centralized location where spacecraft can refuel and repair is a massive necessity. We are on a mission to build the missing piece of space infrastructure that connects the space superhighway, Just like how service stations were built on Earth back in the day!",
        "problem": "All spacecraft and space missions face a standard set of challenges. Fuel is a limited and difficult resource to transport. In the event of a significant issue, spacecraft cannot be repaired in space. These challenges have significantly hindered efficiency in current space missions and have been a substantial obstacle in humanity's quest to explore space further. Unlike a road trip where refueling is common and convenient, spacecraft face a unique challenge. Spacecraft cannot refuel along the way. Instead, they must carry all the fuel required for the mission from Earth. An overwhelming 85% - 95% of the launch weight is fuel on a typical launch vehicle, with 80-90% burned off to reach orbit. \ud83d\ude80 As a result, spacecraft that transport loads in space (space tugs) can only perform, on average, 25% as many missions as they're technically capable of due to the absence of refueling in space. \ud83d\udef0\ufe0f Furthermore, even if a spacecraft wanted to carry additional fuel, it is not easy. Current spacecraft require cryogenic fuels such as liquid oxygen, methane, and liquid hydrogen, which must be stored and transferred at extremely low temperatures of -285\u00b0F. \ud83e\udd76 Environmental factors in space, such as heat and radiation, increase the temperature of these fuels, causing them to boil off (vaporize). In addition, there is no current solution for spacecraft repair. This means that today's spacecraft must operate flawlessly to maximize efficiency, which is only sometimes the case. For instance, Eutelsat Communications' satellites experienced power loss mid-mission with no option for repair, resulting in a $30 million revenue loss. With Spaceium's multifunction robotic arm, the communication satellite could have been fixed. \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f",
        "solution": "Automated servicing stations in space \ud83c\udf0e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udef0\ufe0f Our primary solution aims to improve space missions' efficiency by addressing refueling challenges. The developed cryogenic fuel storage and transfer technology is designed to store fuel without any boil-off for multiple years in space. As a result, spacecraft can now refuel in space, carry more payload, and travel longer distances. Two fundamental principles guide our proprietary Zero Boil Off (ZBO) technology. Our cryogenic storage system is not only efficient but also highly scalable. Our current cooling system is 65% more efficient than any other cooling system, and our scalable storage system can store up to 30 metric tons of fuel, making it adaptable to a wide range of space missions and requirements. After successfully addressing the challenge of transporting large amounts of space fuel, we turned our attention to developing technology for delivering this fuel to spacecraft in space. This is achieved through the use of a multifunction robotic arm. This advanced arm can securely dock with incoming spacecraft and initiate the fuel transfer. The fluid system built within the arm allows the transfer of different fuel types through the robotic arm. The built-in thermal system ensures that fuel is transferred to the customer's spacecraft at the correct temperature without any boil-off issues associated with cryogenic fuels in space. Additionally, the same robotic arm is versatile enough to handle non-cryogenic fuels as well, providing a comprehensive solution for refueling spacecraft in space. In addition to safe and efficient fuel transfer, the robotic arm is equipped with an interchangeable end effector designed for in-space repairs. In-space repairs are achieved through a fully automated robotic arm that can retrieve tools from a stored \"toolbox\" within the system. This innovative feature ensures that even in the event of a significant issue, spacecraft can be repaired in space, minimizing the risk of mission failure and maximizing mission efficiency. Our vision is to transform the space industry. Starting in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), our servicing infrastructure will progressively expand to encompass Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO), the moon, and eventually Mars. We are on a mission to empower space missions to go further, explore more, and achieve what was once deemed impossible. Who can benefit from our service stations in space",

To meet the soaring demand for clean energy, the US must build an equivalent amount of clean generation by 2035 to the total electricity supplied by all sources today. Despite this rapid deployment, utility-scale clean energy developers often spend months assessing and preparing their projects for financing and construction due to varying policies, interconnection, and permitting requirements across jurisdictions. This pre-construction phase is an error-prone and manual effort of researching and aggregating data across thousands of PDFs, websites, and maps. Many developers find themselves poring over 1000-page documents, engaging expensive consultants, or focusing on a limited number of jurisdictions. Through hundreds of conversations with developers, we consistently hear that navigating this \"complex patchwork of jurisdictions, where every state is a snowflake,\" is a major obstacle. \u2728 Enter Spark With Spark, developers can identify requirements, risks, and incentives by leveraging our curated dataset.

Besides that, scaling into multiple channels often entails adding new warehouse locations through the supply chain, be it by sourcing raw materials by yourself or adding FBA as an outbound fulfiller. This is accompanied by rising logistics costs and inventory constraints (such as the low inventory level fee of Amazon or expiration date requirements for sales channels). The combination of these aspects leaves supply chain managers with a sheer amount of different constraints to handle \u2013 often in very large spreadsheets. This leads to inventory distortion costs \u2013 the cost of stockouts and overstock \u2013 which is a $1.8 trillion USD problem for retailers worldwide. \u2705 The solution Spherecast combines demand planning, replenishment and inventory optimization in one platform.

We are applying this technology to clinically tested, but highly toxic cancer immunotherapies to make them safer and more effective. Who we are/Team: SynsoryBio was founded by brother scientists, Elliot and Nathan, who both hold PhDs in biomedical engineering. The founders gained expertise in synthetic biology at Boston University, Harvard Medical School, and industrial biotech, where they authored numerous high-impact journal publications and are inventors on several patent filings. SynsoryBio harnesses this expertise to create next-generation therapeutics that understand where they are in the body and only act at the site of disease. The Problem: The most potent therapeutics suffer from safety issues and dose limitations, impeding their development and overall efficacy. This isn\u2019t surprising because most therapeutics are delivered systemically and are active throughout the body even though the underlying disease is localized to a certain tissue. For example, immunotherapies to treat cancer show great promise but usually exhibit dose limitations, especially in combination, which prevents the development of potent immune stimulators and/or mitigates clinical efficacy. The Synsory Solution: We are developing next-generation protein therapeutics that have synthetic sensing functions so that they know where they are in the body and only act at disease tissue. Our approach is highly flexible, allowing us to design protein therapeutics that conditionally activate upon sensing virtually any specified biomolecule.

DeFi users and high-volume memecoin flippers can now use an AI assistant to calculate taxes with greater accuracy and find trends in their trade history. \u2014 Hey everyone, we\u2019re Colin and Amith. We\u2019re building TokenOwl to save traders time and money. \ud83d\udcb0 The problem: Current crypto tax software solutions work fine for traditional buy-and-hold crypto users with dozens or hundreds of transactions per year, but they aren\u2019t built for DeFi users and high-volume memecoin traders. They tend to mislabel these transactions which can lead to capital gains calculations being incorrect. The only way to fix such mistakes is for the user to spend hours\u2013sometimes even days with enough transactions\u2013troubleshooting their tax report. They also cost too much for users with thousands of transactions. As the IRS increases scrutiny on digital assets, reporting crypto capital gains and income accurately will be crucial. The culprit ($WIF): Our solution: LLMs are really good at processing large amounts of nuanced data (like complex DeFi transactions). We are building a solution that leverages LLMs to reduce breakage when generating tax reports and minimize the time spent on troubleshooting/understanding transaction logs. Users can also query their logs directly with natural language, to unlock new possibilities in analysis and review. This makes for a smooth experience for both experienced traders and occasional investors who need help parsing their portfolios. Why now: Users migrating to low fee chains like Solana and Ethereum L2s means way more people are trading at high volumes. Solana DEX volume alone has consistently been $2-3B daily in recent weeks. These traders are going to have a very tough time sorting this out with existing solutions (not to mention paying hundreds to thousands of dollars). The next million crypto users will look more like these DeFi farmers and rapid memecoin flippers than Bitcoin hodlers. They need a new way to calculate taxes and understand their portfolio. How it works: Connect your wallets and exchanges just as you would with a traditional tax reporting solution. You can then immediately start asking our AI assistant questions in natural language. This can be anything from reconciliation for tax purposes (\u201cIs the transaction on June 12th where I provided ETH and USDC to a liquidity pool not considered a taxable event?\u201d) to higher level understanding of your portfolio (\u201cWhy was June such an outlier for my capital gains?\u201d). Once everything looks good, you can export your tax summary for TurboTax. About us: Colin was previously a technical lead at IncQuery. He studied decentralized finance under economist Cam Harvey at Duke. Amith was previously at UChicago pursuing a Master\u2019s in computer science, and a developer at Amazon before that. Having traded crypto at high volume personally, we\u2019ve dreaded tax season every year because of all the manual review it entails. We are building this to enable compliance for DeFi users, high-volume traders, new investors, and even businesses that want to explore managing their finances in DeFi responsibly.

Tower also allows counsels to use natural language to search through all matters, including communications and documents. In-house counsels currently spend 30 to 90 (!)% of their day working on highly repetitive, manual tasks; Tower frees them to work on more value-add and meaningful projects.",

The autonomous control of traffic lights gives back to both city officials and their citizens their most valuable resource - time. \u2014 Hi everyone, we\u2019re Everett, Luke, and Brian, the founders of XTraffic. Why Now? The combination of rapidly advancing technology and smart-city initiatives has created a unique intersection in time where intelligent traffic control is not just possible but affordable. As smart city initiatives are being adopted worldwide, municipalities of all sizes are looking for ways to affordably transition to intelligent infrastructure. XTraffic leverages this trend by providing cities with a scalable, intelligent system that upgrades existing traffic lights into a self-optimizing network. Market Opportunity The global smart city market is projected to reach $3.84 trillion by 2029, with traffic management as a requirement to aid in driving this growth. Urban areas are expanding, and traffic congestion is a major pain point that costs the U.S. more than $70.4 billion in 2023, a 15% increase from 2022. XTraffic is tapping into this immense market opportunity by offering a solution that not only reduces traffic congestion but also enhances safety, reduces emissions, and increases overall quality of life. Why XTraffic? Our system isn\u2019t just about less traffic; it\u2019s about smarter use of our infrastructure. XTraffic's approach allows traffic lights to 'talk' to each other, making real-time decisions based on current conditions across an entire network. This holistic view enables our system to adapt dynamically to changing traffic patterns, emergencies, and other factors - this significantly reduces delays and optimizes traffic flow across entire cities. With our solution, cities can avoid the massive costs of overhauling infrastructure. Instead, they can implement an affordable, flexible system that integrates seamlessly with existing technology. This reduces the barrier to entry and allows for rapid deployment, scaling from single intersections to entire metropolitan areas. Call to Action We\u2019re excited to be part of Y Combinator, and we\u2019re looking forward to connecting with cities, investors, and partners who share our vision for smarter, safer, and more efficient urban environments.

Combined, we have experience working in Bayer, Berkeley AI Research, Jane Street, Optiver and Cisco. Jan ranked top 11 in the International Chemistry Olympiad for 3 years in a row. Problem: There are more than 10M different compounds created each year. Chemists need to figure out how to make them. To do so, they often rely on literature data. Unfortunately, this data almost never contains the exact recipe and the ones out there are often misreported and irreproducible in the lab. This means that chemists still need to frequently rely on their intuition, and when that fails, a potentially life-saving drug might never see the light of day. Solution: Foundation model for chemical reactions We are generating our own dataset of chemical experiments. We will use it to train a powerful model capable of defining good conditions for any organic reaction. We\u2019ve performed feasibility studies on smaller datasets and confirmed our beliefs that if we choose the experiments very carefully, we will be able to cover 3 of the most popular reactions in organic chemistry with only 20k data points. We\u2019ve already created an app that learns from the chemists\u2019 experimental data as they run their reactions in the lab. This allows them to find the optimal conditions in days instead of weeks or months. Our custom algorithms allow the app to run fully offline from the chemist's PC to account for data sensitivity. Additionally, we designed the app to be simple to use so that every chemist can employ state-of-the-art statistics and machine learning in their lab in just a few clicks.

Think of a knowledge graph as a network of interconnected facts, such as \u201cKendra loves Adidas shoes.\u201d Each fact is a \u201ctriplet, represented by two entities, or nodes (\u201dKendra,\u201d \u201cAdidas shoes\u201d), and their relationship, or edge (\u201dloves\u201d). Knowledge Graphs have been explored extensively for information retrieval. What makes Graphiti unique is its ability to autonomously build a knowledge graph while handling changing relationships and maintaining historical context. At Zep, we build a memory layer for LLM applications. Developers use Zep to recall relevant user information from past conversations without including the entire chat history in a prompt. Accurate context is crucial for LLM applications.

[3] and more powerful models small enough to run at the edge could unlock a lot: eg. extreme compression for face-to-face video streaming enhanced, spatial-aware transcription w/ lip-reading detecting deepfakes in the wild on-device real-time video translation etc. who are we? Prady Modukuru [CEO] | Led product for a research team at Microsoft that made Defender a $350M+ product, took MSR research into production moving it from bottom of market to #1 in industry evals. Rudrabha Mukhopadhyay [CTO] | PhD CVIT @ IIIT-Hyderabad, co-authored wav2lip / 20+ major publications + 1200+ citations in the last 5 years. Prajwal K R [CRO] | PhD, VGG @ University of Oxford, w/ Andrew Zisserman, prev. Research Scientist @ Meta, authored multiple breakthrough research papers (incl. Wav2Lip) on understanding and generating humans in video Pavan Reddy [COO/CFO] 2x venture-backed founder/operator, built the first smart air purifier in India, prev. monetizing sota research @ IIIT-Hyderabad, engineering @ IIT Madras how did we meet? Prajwal + Rudrabha worked together at IIIT-hyderabad \u2014 and became famous by shipping the world\u2019s first model that could sync the lips in a video to any audio in the wild in any language, no training required. they formed a company w/ Pavan and then worked w/ the university to monetize state-of-the-art research coming out of the labs and bring it to market. Prady met everyone online \u2014 first by hacking together a viral app around their open source models, then collaborating on product + research for fun, to cofounding sync. + going mega-viral. Since then we\u2019ve hacked irl across 4 different countries, across the US coasts, and moved into a hacker house in SF together. what\u2019s our ask? try out our playground and API and let us know how we can make it easier to understand and simpler to use \ud83d\ude04 play around here: https://app.synclabs.so/playground",
