            <h2>My Little Experiment</h2>
            <p class="highlight">"Cultivating linguistic forests from YC startup pitches using bio-inspired grammar trees to map pitch patterns."</p>
            <p>Hi there! I'm Aman, and welcome to YC-Dendrolinguistics, my personal attempt to understand the fascinating world of startup pitches. This project started with a simple question that kept bugging me: "What makes a startup pitch tick?" As I dove into the vast ocean of Y Combinator (YC) startup descriptions, I found myself drawing parallels between the structure of language and the branching patterns of trees. And so, my little linguistic forest began to grow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What I'm Trying to Do</h2>
            <p>I'm not claiming to have all the answers, but I'm excited to explore. My approach borrows ideas from linguistics, data science, and even a bit of biology. I'm looking at YC startup pitches, trying to map out how they're structured, and seeing if I can spot any patterns.</p>
            <p>Here's what I'm up to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Breaking down startup pitches into their basic parts</li>
                <li>Creating tree-like structures to represent these pitches</li>
                <li>Looking for common themes and elements</li>
                <li>Visualizing my findings in ways that hopefully make sense</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's a bit like being a language detective, only with more graphs and probably a few too many tree puns.</p>

            <h2>My Toolkit</h2>
            <div class="component">
                <h3>Startup Similarity Search</h3>
                <p>Built a similarity search tool that lets you explore how different startups describe themselves. It's not just standard regex like search, but instead semantic search, where I download a local model on to your browser and you do the computing! (Yes, On-Prem)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="component">
                <h3>Interactive Scatterplots</h3>
                <p>I've created some colorful dots that represent different aspects of startup pitches. It's my way seeing patterns that might be hiding in plain sight.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="component">
                <h3>Probability Trees</h3>
                <p>Remember those sentence diagrams from school? I'm doing something similar with startup pitches, creating trees that show how different parts of a pitch tend to branch out. It's part art, part science, and entirely experimental.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why I'm Doing This</h2>
            <p>Honestly? I'm curious. I believe there's something to learn from how successful startups talk about themselves. My hope is that this project might:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Give aspiring entrepreneurs some food for thought when crafting their pitches</li>
                <li>Provide a new perspective for those interested in startup trends</li>
                <li>Maybe, just maybe, contribute a small piece to the puzzle of understanding startup communication</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But mostly, I'm doing this because I find it fascinating, and I hope you might too.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What's Next?</h2>
            <p>I'm still figuring that out! This project is very much a work in progress. I'm learning as I go, and I'm excited to see where this linguistic journey takes me. Got ideas? I'd love to hear them. Let me know!</p>
            <p>Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet. I hope you find something interesting here, even if it's just a new way of looking at the language of innovation.</p>
